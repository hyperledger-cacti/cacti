/**
 * SATP Gateway Client (Business Logic Orchestrator)
 * SATP is a protocol operating between two gateways that conducts the transfer of a digital asset from one gateway to another. The protocol establishes a secure channel between the endpoints and implements a 2-phase commit to ensure the properties of transfer atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.  This API defines the gateway client facing API (business logic orchestrator, or BLO), which is named API-Type 1 in the SATP-Core specification.  **Additional Resources**: - [Proposed SATP Charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-satp/) - [SATP Core draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-satp-core) - [SATP Crash Recovery draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-belchior-satp-gateway-recovery/) - [SATP Architecture draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-satp-architecture/) - [SATP Use-Cases draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ramakrishna-sat-use-cases/) - [SATP Data sharing draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ramakrishna-satp-data-sharing) - [SATP View Addresses draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ramakrishna-satp-views-addresses)
