/**
 * @fileoverview
 * SATP Bridge Leaf Fungible Asset Interface for cross-chain fungible token operations.
 *
 * Defines the abstract interface for bridge leaf components that handle fungible digital
 * assets (tokens with divisible amounts) in SATP cross-chain transfer operations. This
 * interface establishes the contract for asset wrapping, locking, minting, burning, and
 * assignment operations required for secure atomic cross-chain transfers.
 *
 * **SATP Protocol Context:**
 * - Asset Wrapping: Encapsulation of native assets for cross-chain representation
 * - Asset Locking: Phase 2 lock operations for atomic transfers
 * - Asset Minting: Phase 3 asset creation on destination networks
 * - Asset Burning: Phase 3 asset destruction on source networks
 * - Asset Assignment: Ownership transfer within cross-chain operations
 *
 * **Fungible Asset Operations:**
 * - Wrapper contract deployment and management
 * - Asset amount-based operations (lock, mint, burn with quantities)
 * - Transaction receipt retrieval and validation
 * - Cross-chain proof generation and verification
 *
 * @module BridgeLeafFungible
 *
 * @example
 * Implementing fungible bridge leaf:
 * ```typescript
 * class EthereumFungibleLeaf extends BridgeLeafFungible {
 *   async wrapAsset(asset: Asset): Promise<TransactionResponse> {
 *     const wrapperContract = await this.getWrapperContract();
 *     return await wrapperContract.wrap(
 *       asset.contractAddress,
 *       asset.id,
 *       asset.amount
 *     );
 *   }
 *
 *   async lockAsset(assetId: string, amount: number): Promise<TransactionResponse> {
 *     return await this.wrapperContract.lock(assetId, amount);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * Cross-chain fungible transfer coordination:
 * ```typescript
 * const sourceLeaf = new EthereumFungibleLeaf(sourceConfig);
 * const targetLeaf = new FabricFungibleLeaf(targetConfig);
 *
 * // Phase 2: Lock asset on source network
 * const lockResult = await sourceLeaf.lockAsset(asset.id, transferAmount);
 *
 * // Phase 3: Mint on target, burn on source
 * await targetLeaf.mintAsset(targetAsset.id, transferAmount);
 * await sourceLeaf.burnAsset(asset.id, transferAmount);
 * ```

/**
 * Abstract interface for SATP bridge leaf operations on fungible digital assets.
 *
 * @description
 * Defines the contract for bridge leaf components that handle fungible assets (tokens
 * with divisible amounts) in cross-chain transfer operations. This interface provides
 * the essential methods required for asset wrapping, locking, minting, burning, and
 * assignment operations within the SATP protocol framework.
 *
 * **Fungible Asset Characteristics:**
 * - Divisible token amounts supporting fractional transfers
 * - Amount-based locking and unlocking operations
 * - Quantity-specific minting and burning operations
 * - Batch processing capabilities for multiple asset operations
 * - Decimal precision handling for accurate amount transfers
 *
 * **SATP Protocol Integration:**
 * - Phase 1: Asset definition and wrapper contract deployment
 * - Phase 2: Asset locking with amount specification
 * - Phase 3: Coordinated minting and burning with precise amounts
 * - Recovery: Amount-specific rollback and unlock operations
 *
 * @abstract
 * @class BridgeLeafFungible
 *
 * @example
 * Implementing ERC20 fungible bridge leaf:
 * ```typescript
 * class ERC20BridgeLeaf extends BridgeLeafFungible {
 *   async deployFungibleWrapperContract(): Promise<void> {
 *     const contract = await this.deployContract(ERC20WrapperABI);
 *     this.wrapperAddress = contract.address;
 *   }
 *
 *   async lockAsset(assetId: string, amount: number): Promise<TransactionResponse> {
