/**
 * SATP-Hermes Public API - Secure Asset Transfer Protocol Implementation
 *
 * @fileoverview
 * Public API exports for the SATP-Hermes plugin, implementing the IETF SATP v2 core specification
 * for fault-tolerant cross-chain asset transfers. Provides gateway-based interoperability with
 * crash recovery mechanisms and atomic transaction guarantees.
 *
 * **SATP Protocol Context:**
 * - Transfer Initiation: Gateway authentication and asset definition exchange
 * - Lock-Evidence Verification: Asset locking with cryptographic proof generation
 * - Commitment Establishment: Atomic asset burn/mint operations across networks
 *
 * **Architecture Integration:**
 * - Gateway-to-gateway communication model for cross-chain interoperability
 * - Fault-tolerant middleware with crash recovery and rollback capabilities
 * - ACID properties enforcement for distributed blockchain transactions
 * - Bridge mechanisms for heterogeneous blockchain network integration
 *
 * @module SatpHermesPublicAPI
 *
 * @example
 * Basic gateway setup and asset transfer:
 * ```typescript
 * import {
 *   SATPGateway,
 *   SATPGatewayConfig,
 *   DEFAULT_PORT_GATEWAY_SERVER
 * } from '@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-satp-hermes';
 *
 * const gateway = new SATPGateway({
 *   gatewayId: 'gateway-fabric',
 *   networkId: 'fabric-network-1',
 *   serverPort: DEFAULT_PORT_GATEWAY_SERVER
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * Cross-chain bridge configuration:
 * ```typescript
 * import { IBesuLeafNeworkOptions, INetworkOptions } from '@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-satp-hermes';
 *
 * const besuConfig: IBesuLeafNeworkOptions = {
 *   networkId: 'besu-testnet',
 *   rpcEndpoint: 'http://localhost:8545'
 * };
 * ```
