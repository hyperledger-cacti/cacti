/**
 * @fileoverview
 * SATP Logger - Specialized Logging Implementation with Monitoring Integration
 *
 * @description
 * This module provides a specialized logger implementation for SATP (Secure Asset Transfer
 * Protocol) operations within the Hyperledger Cacti ecosystem. It extends standard logging
 * capabilities with integrated monitoring services, ensuring comprehensive observability
 * and debugging support throughout the SATP protocol lifecycle.
 *
 * **Core Features:**
 * - **Dual Logging**: Simultaneously logs to standard backend and monitoring service
 * - **Level Management**: Supports dynamic log level configuration and updates
 * - **Monitoring Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with SATP monitoring infrastructure
 * - **Protocol Context**: Optimized for SATP protocol operations and debugging
 * - **Structured Logging**: Provides consistent log formatting across SATP components
 *
 * **Monitoring Benefits:**
 * - **Centralized Observability**: All SATP logs are captured by monitoring service
 * - **Real-time Tracking**: Enables real-time monitoring of SATP operations
 * - **Debug Support**: Facilitates comprehensive debugging and troubleshooting
 * - **Audit Trail**: Maintains detailed audit trails for compliance and analysis
 * - **Performance Monitoring**: Supports performance analysis and optimization
 *
 * **Usage Context:**
 * This logger is specifically designed for SATP protocol components including
 * services, handlers, sessions, and utilities. It ensures consistent logging
 * behavior while providing enhanced monitoring capabilities essential for
 * production SATP deployments.

/**
 * SATP-specific logger implementation with integrated monitoring capabilities.
 *
 * @description
 * Provides specialized logging functionality for SATP protocol operations with
 * dual output to both standard logging backend and monitoring service. This
 * ensures comprehensive observability and debugging support throughout the
 * SATP protocol lifecycle.
 *
 * **Key Capabilities:**
 * - **Dual Output**: Logs to both standard backend and monitoring service
 * - **Dynamic Configuration**: Supports runtime log level changes
 * - **Structured Logging**: Consistent formatting for SATP operations
 * - **Monitoring Integration**: Seamless integration with monitoring infrastructure
 * - **Resource Management**: Proper lifecycle management and cleanup
 *
 * **Logging Levels:**
 * - **trace**: Detailed execution flow and internal state information
 * - **debug**: Detailed debugging information for development and troubleshooting
 * - **info**: General informational messages about normal operations
 * - **warn**: Warning messages about potential issues or unusual conditions
 * - **error**: Error messages about failures and exception conditions
