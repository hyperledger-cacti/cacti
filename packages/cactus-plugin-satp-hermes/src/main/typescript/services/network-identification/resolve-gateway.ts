/**
 * @fileoverview Gateway Resolution Service - Gateway discovery and identification
 *
 * This module provides gateway resolution and discovery services for SATP
 * cross-chain operations. Enables dynamic gateway discovery, identity resolution,
 * and seed gateway management for establishing gateway-to-gateway communication
 * in distributed SATP networks.
 *
 * **Key Functionality:**
 * - Gateway identity resolution by ID
 * - Seed gateway discovery and registration
 * - Mock gateway repository for testing and development
 * - Dynamic gateway network participation
 *
 * @module GatewayResolution
 * @since 0.0.3-beta

/**
 * Resolves a gateway identity by its unique identifier.
 *
 * @description
 * Queries the gateway repository to retrieve complete identity information
 * for a specified gateway ID. This function enables dynamic gateway discovery
 * and connection establishment in SATP networks. Currently implements a mock
 * repository for testing; production implementations should query a distributed
 * gateway registry or discovery service.
 *
 * **Resolution Process:**
 * 1. Accepts a gateway unique identifier
 * 2. Queries the gateway repository (currently mock data)
 * 3. Returns complete GatewayIdentity with network configuration
 * 4. Enables gateway-to-gateway communication setup
 *
 * **Mock Implementation:**
 * Current implementation uses hardcoded gateway identities for testing.
 * Production deployments should integrate with:
 * - Distributed gateway registries
 * - DNS-based gateway discovery
 * - Blockchain-based gateway registration systems
 * - Centralized gateway coordination services
 *
 * @param logger - SATP logger instance for operation tracking
 * @param ID - Unique identifier of the gateway to resolve
 * @returns Promise resolving to the complete GatewayIdentity
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const gatewayId = await resolveGatewayID(logger, "gateway-1");
 * console.log(`Resolved gateway: ${gatewayId.name}`);
 * console.log(`Gateway address: ${gatewayId.address}:${gatewayId.gatewayServerPort}`);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link GatewayIdentity} for gateway identity structure
 * @see {@link getGatewaySeeds} for seed gateway discovery
 *
 * @todo Replace mock implementation with production gateway registry

/**
 * Retrieves seed gateways for SATP network bootstrapping.
 *
 * @description
 * Returns a list of well-known "seed" gateways that can be used for
 * initial network discovery and gateway-to-gateway connection establishment.
 * Similar to Bitcoin's seed nodes, these gateways serve as initial entry
 * points into the SATP gateway network.
 *
 * **Seed Gateway Purpose:**
 * - Bootstrap gateway network participation
 * - Provide initial gateway discovery endpoints
 * - Enable decentralized gateway network formation
 * - Facilitate dynamic gateway registration and discovery
 *
 * **Current Implementation:**
 * Returns an empty array as a placeholder. Production implementations
 * should return a list of known, reliable seed gateways configured for
 * the deployment environment (development, staging, production).
 *
 * **Production Considerations:**
 * - Configure environment-specific seed gateways
 * - Implement fallback mechanisms for seed gateway failures
 * - Support multiple seed gateways for redundancy
 * - Enable dynamic seed gateway updates without redeployment
 * - Consider DNS-based seed gateway resolution
 *
 * @param logger - SATP logger instance for operation tracking
 * @returns Array of seed gateway identities for network bootstrapping
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const seedGateways = getGatewaySeeds(logger);
 * for (const gateway of seedGateways) {
 *   await orchestrator.connectToGateway(gateway);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link GatewayIdentity} for gateway identity structure
 * @see {@link resolveGatewayID} for gateway resolution by ID
 * @see {@link GatewayOrchestrator} for gateway connection management
 *
 * @todo Implement production seed gateway configuration
 * @todo Add environment-specific seed gateway lists
 * @since 0.0.3-beta
