# `@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric`

This plugin provides `Cactus` a way to interact with Fabric networks. Using this we can perform:
* Deploy Golang chaincodes.
* Make transactions.
* Invoke chaincodes functions that we have deployed on the network.

## Getting Started

Clone the git repository on your local machine. Follow these instructions that will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In the root of the project to install the dependencies execute the command:
```sh
npm run comfigure
```
### Compiling

In the project root folder, run this command to compile the plugin and create the dist directory:
```sh
npm run tsc
```
## Usage

To use this import public-api and create new **PluginLedgerConnectorFabric** and **ChainCodeCompiler**. 
```typescript
  const connector: PluginLedgerConnectorFabric = new PluginLedgerConnectorFabric(pluginOptions);
  const compiler = new ChainCodeCompiler({ logLevel });
```
For compile the chaincodes:
```typescript
  const opts: ICompilationOptions = {
    fileName: "hello-world-contract.go",
    moduleName: "hello-world-contract",
    pinnedDeps: ["github.com/hyperledger/fabric@v1.4.8"],
    modTidyOnly: true, // we just need the go.mod file so tidy only is enough
    sourceCode: HELLO_WORLD_CONTRACT_GO_SOURCE,
  };

  const result = await compiler.compile(opts);
```

## Running the tests

To check that all has been installed correctly and that the pugin has no errors, run the tests:

* Run this command at the project's root:
```sh
npm run test:plugin-ledger-connector-fabric
```
## Prometheus Exporter

This class creates a prometheus exporter, which scraps the transactions (total transaction count) for the use cases incorporating the use of Fabric connector plugin.


### Usage Prometheus
The prometheus exporter object is initialized in the `PluginLedgerConnectorFabric` class constructor itself, so instantiating the object of the `PluginLedgerConnectorFabric` class, gives access to the exporter object.
You can also initialize the prometheus exporter object seperately and then pass it to the `IPluginLedgerConnectorFabricOptions` interface for `PluginLedgerConnectoFabric` constructor.

`getPrometheusExporterMetricsEndpointV1` function returns the prometheus exporter metrics, currently displaying the total transaction count, which currently increments everytime the `transact()` method of the `PluginLedgerConnectorFabric` class is called.

### Prometheus Integration
To use Prometheus with this exporter make sure to install [Prometheus main component](https://prometheus.io/download/).
Once Prometheus is setup, the corresponding scrape_config needs to be added to the prometheus.yml

```(yaml)
- job_name: 'fabric_ledger_connector_exporter'
  metrics_path: api/v1/plugins/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/get-prometheus-exporter-metrics
  scrape_interval: 5s
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['{host}:{port}']
```

Here the `host:port` is where the prometheus exporter metrics are exposed. The test cases (For example, packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/src/test/typescript/integration/fabric-v1-4-x/run-transaction-endpoint-v1.test.ts) exposes it over `0.0.0.0` and a random port(). The random port can be found in the running logs of the test case and looks like (42379 in the below mentioned URL)
`Metrics URL: http://0.0.0.0:42379/api/v1/plugins/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric/get-prometheus-exporter-metrics`

Once edited, you can start the prometheus service by referencing the above edited prometheus.yml file.
On the prometheus graphical interface (defaulted to http://localhost:9090), choose **Graph** from the menu bar, then select the **Console** tab. From the **Insert metric at cursor** drop down, select **cactus_fabric_total_tx_count** and click **execute**

### Helper code
