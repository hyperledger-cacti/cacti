# `@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-sawtooth`

This plugin provides `Cacti` a way to interact with Sawtooth networks. Using this we can perform:

- Check plugin and sawtooth node status.
- Monitor new blocks and transactions on the ledger.

## Getting Started

Clone the git repository on your local machine. Follow these instructions that will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In the root of the project to install the dependencies execute the command:

```sh
npm run configure
```

## Usage

Before running the connector please ensure that Sawtooth node is running and that connector will have direct access to it. Access through a proxy is not supported yet (see https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/1.2/sysadmin_guide/rest_auth_proxy.html).
To use this import public-api and create new **PluginLedgerConnectorSawtooth**.

```typescript
const connector = new PluginLedgerConnectorSawtooth({
  instanceId: uuidV4(),
  logLevel: testLogLevel,
  sawtoothRestApiEndpoint: ledgerRestApi,
  watchBlocksPollTime,
});
```

You can make calls through the connector to the plugin API:

```typescript
async getStatus(): Promise<StatusResponseV1>
```

Please note that `deployContract()` and `transact()`, although available to call, **are not implemented and will throw error on runtime!**

## SawtoothApiClient

All connector API endpoints are defined in [open-api specification](./src/main/json/openapi.json). You can use [SawtoothApiClient](./src/main/typescript/api-client) to call remote sawtooth connector functions. It also contain additional utility functions to ease integration.

### REST Functions

See [DefaultApi](./src/main/typescript/generated/openapi/typescript-axios/api.ts) for up-to-date listing of supported endpoints.

- getStatusV1

### Asynchronous Functions (socket.io)

- watchBlocksV1

## Running the tests

To check that all has been installed correctly and that the plugin has no errors run jest test suites.

- Run this command at the project's root:

```sh
npx jest cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-sawtooth
```

#### Running the container

Launch container with plugin configuration as an **environment variable**:

```sh
# FIXME
```

Launch container with plugin configuration as a **CLI argument**:

```sh
# FIXME
```

Launch container with **configuration file** mounted from host machine:

```sh
# FIXME
```

```sh
# FIXME
```
