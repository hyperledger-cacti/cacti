Please commit here your ConnectionChain code as-is as a first step.
If possible, use the commit message
`feat(connection-chain) adding source code in bulk`

The commit message structure that we intend to use is the conventional commits:
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
This will help with automation of releases and their change logs which we do not
intend to manually write for every release (we intend to release often, at regular intervals)

Feel free to delete this README file at the time when committing the ConnectionChain code.

Please ensure that the commit is signed off in git.
