 * Summary:
 * Connector: monitoring class of a part dependent on end-chains
 * Used in the case of monitoring continuously.
 * Processing that ends with the acceptance of a single event is handled by a custom function implementation in server plugins.
 * Unlike server plugins, it basically does not handle its own functions.
