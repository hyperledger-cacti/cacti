 * Class responsible for providing additional functionality to the `DefaultApi`
 * classes of the generated clients (OpenAPI generator / typescript-axios).
 *
 * Each package (plugin) can define it's own OpenAPI spec which means that they
 * all can ship with their own `DefaultApi` class that is generated directly
 * from the respective OpenAPI spec of the package/plugin.
 *
 * The functionality provided by this class is meant to be common traints that
 * can be useful for all of those different `DefaultApi` implementations.
 *
 * One such common trait is the client side component of the routing that
 * decides which Cactus node to point the `ApiClient` towards (which is in
 * itself ends up being the act of routing).

   * routing requests to a specific ledger via a connector plugin, but later
   * other uses could be added as well).
   *
   * The `DefaultConsortiumProvider` class leverages the simplest consortium
   * plugin that we have at the time of this writing:
   * `@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-consortium-manual` which holds the consortium
   * metadata as pre-configured by the consortium operators.
   *
   * The pattern we use in the `ApiClient` class is that you can inject your
   * own `IAsyncProvider<Consortium>` implementation which then will be used
   * for routing information and in theory you can implement completely arbitrary
   * consortium management in your own consortium plugins which then Cactus
   * can use and leverage for the routing.
   * This allows us to support any exotic consortium management algorithms
   * that people may come up with such as storing the consortium definiton in
   * a multi-sig smart contract or have the list of consortium nodes be powered
   * by some sort of automatic service discovery or anything else that people
   * might think of.
