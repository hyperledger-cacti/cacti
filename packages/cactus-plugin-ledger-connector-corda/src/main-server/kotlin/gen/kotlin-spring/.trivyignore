#         Snakeyaml is being used by Jackson and liquidbase. Corda does not use
#         Jackson for deserialization except in the optional shell which we
#         recommend using standalone. The Corda node itself is not exposed.
#         Corda does however provide mappings of Corda types to allow CorDapps
#         to use Jackson, and CorDapps using Jackson should make their own
#         assessment. Liquibase is used to apply the database migration changes.
#         XML files are used here to define the changes not YAML and therefore
#         the Corda node itself is not exposed to this deserialisation
#         vulnerability.
