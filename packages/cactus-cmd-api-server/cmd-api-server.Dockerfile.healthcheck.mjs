/**
 * The healthcheck script for the Cacti API Server written in pure NodeJS without
 * any external dependencies.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ node cmd-api-server.Dockerfile.healthcheck.mjs http localhost 4000
 * http://localhost:4000/api/v1/api-server/healthcheck Healthcheck OK:  200 OK
 * ```
 *
 * FAQ
 * ---
 *
 * Q: Why though? Why not just use cURL or wget
 * or any other command line utility to perform HTTP requests?
 * A: This has zero OS level package dependencies and will work without the
 *    container image having to have new software installed. This reduces the footprint
 *    of the image and also the attack surfaces that we have. The slight increase in
 *    complexity is a trade-off we consider worth having because this script is not
 *    part of the API server's own codebase and therefore does not affect the complexity
 *    of that as such.
