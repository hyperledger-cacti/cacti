# `@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-persistence-ethereum`

This plugin allows `Cactus` to persist Ethereum data into some storage (currently to a `PostgreSQL` database, but this concept can be extended further).
Data in the database can later be analyzed and viewed in a GUI tool.

## Remarks

- This plugin was only tested with small, permissioned Ethereum ledgers. Running it to archive and monitor large ledgers (like main net) is not recommended yet.
- For now, the database schema is not considered public and can change over time (i.e., writing own application that reads data directly from the database is discouraged).
- Only `status` endpoint is available, all the methods must be called directly on the plugin instance for now.
- Monitored ERC20 tokens should be added before synchronizing the database (previous transfers will not be parsed correctly if you later add the token).

## Getting Started

Clone the git repository on your local machine. Follow these instructions that will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

#### Build

In the root of the project, execute the command to install and build the dependencies. It will also build this persistence plugin:

```sh
yarn run configure
```

#### Ethereum Ledger and Connector

This plugin requires a running Ethereum ledger that you want to persist to a database. For testing purposes, you can use our [test geth-all-in-one Docker image](../../tools/docker/geth-all-in-one/README.md). Make sure you have the JSON-RPC WS address ready.

Once you have an Ethereum ledger ready, you need to start the [Ethereum Cacti Connector](../cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-ethereum/README.md). We recommend running the connector on the same ApiServer instance as the persistence plugin for better performance and reduced network overhead. See the connector package README for more instructions, or check out the [setup sample scripts](./src/test/typescript/manual).

#### Supabase Instance

You need a running Supabase instance to serve as a database backend for this plugin.

### Setup Tutorials

We've created some sample scripts to help you get started quickly. All the steps have detailed comments on it so you can quickly understand the code.

#### Sample Setup

Location: [./src/test/typescript/manual/sample-setup.ts](./src/test/typescript/manual/sample-setup.ts)

This sample script can be used to set up `ApiServer` with the Ethereum connector and persistence plugins to monitor and store ledger data in a database. You need to have a ledger running before executing this script. You can add custom code (e.g., to specify tokens to be monitored) after the comment `CUSTOM CODE GOES HERE !!!!` in the script file.

By default, the script will try to use a localhost Ethereum ledger (`ws://127.0.0.1:8546`) and our `supabase-all-in-one` instance running on localhost.

```shell
npm run sample-setup
```

Custom ledger and supabase can be set with environment variables `ETHEREUM_RPC_WS_HOST` and `SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`:

```shell
ETHEREUM_RPC_WS_HOST=ws://127.0.0.1:8546 SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://postgres:your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres npm run sample-setup
```

#### Complete Sample Scenario

Location: [./src/test/typescript/manual/common-setup-methods](./src/test/typescript/manual/common-setup-methods)

This script starts the test Ethereum ledger for you, deploys a sample ERC721 contract, and mints some tokens. Then it synchronizes everything to a database and monitors for all new blocks. This script can also be used for manual, end-to-end tests of a plugin.

By default, the script will try to use our `supabase-all-in-one` instance running on localhost.

```shell
npm run complete-sample-scenario
```

Custom supabase can be set with environment variable `SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`:

```shell
SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://postgres:your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres npm run complete-sample-scenario
```

### Usage

Instantiate a new `PluginPersistenceEthereum` instance:

```typescript
import { PluginPersistenceEthereum } from "@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-persistence-ethereum";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

const persistencePlugin = new PluginPersistenceEthereum({
  instanceId: uuidv4(),
  apiClient: new EthereumApiClient(apiConfigOptions),
  logLevel: "info",
  connectionString:
    "postgresql://postgres:your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password@localhost:5432/postgres",
});

// Initialize the connection to the DB
await persistencePlugin.onPluginInit();
```

You can use the persistent plugin to start monitoring token balance changes and synchronize ledger state with the database.
Here is a sample script that adds two tokens to monitor, synchronizes all currently issued ERC721 tokens and starts monitoring for new blocks:

```typescript
// Add ERC20 token under address erc20ContractAddress, monitor all transfers.
await persistencePlugin.addTokenERC20(erc20ContractAddress);

// Add ERC721 token as well to monitor transfers
await persistencePlugin.addTokenERC721(erc721ContractAddress);

// Synchronize all issued ERC721 token balances that we currently monitor
await persistencePlugin.syncERC721Tokens();

// Start monitoring new blocks.
// Transactions in each block are parsed, token transfers update current token balances.
// Entire ledger is synchronized first with the DB (`syncAll` is called) so this operation can take a while on large ledgers!
persistencePlugin.startMonitor((err) => {
  reject(err);
});

// Show current status of the plugin
persistencePlugin.getStatus();
```

> See [plugin integration tests](./src/test/typescript/integration) for complete usage examples.

### Building/running the container image locally

In the Cactus project root say:

```sh
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build ./packages/cactus-plugin-persistence-ethereum/ -f ./packages/cactus-plugin-persistence-ethereum/Dockerfile -t cactus-plugin-persistence-ethereum
```

## Endpoints

### StatusV1 (`/api/v1/plugins/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-persistence-ethereum/status`)

- Returns status of the plugin (latest block read, failed blocks, is monitor running, etc...)

### Plugin Methods

- Most of the plugin functionalities are currently not available through OpenAPI interface, please use direct method calls instead.

#### `onPluginInit`

- Should be called before using the plugin.

#### `shutdown`

- Close the connection to the DB, cleanup any allocated resources.

#### `getStatus`

- Get status report of this instance of persistence plugin.

#### `refreshMonitoredTokens`

- Fetch the metadata of all tokens to be monitored by this persistence plugin.

#### `syncERC721Tokens`

- Synchronize issued tokens for all ERC721 token contract monitored by this persistence plugin.

#### `startMonitor`

- Start the block monitoring process. New blocks from the ledger will be parsed and pushed to the database.

#### `stopMonitor`

- Stop the block monitoring process.

#### `addTokenERC20`

- Add new ERC20 token to be monitored by this plugin.

#### `addTokenERC721`

- Add new ERC721 token to be monitored by this plugin.

#### `syncFailedBlocks`

- Walk through all the blocks that could not be synchronized with the DB for some reasons and try pushing them again.

#### `syncAll`

- Synchronize entire ledger state with the database.

## Running the tests

To run all the tests for this persistence plugin to ensure it's working correctly execute the following from the root of the `cactus` project:

```sh
npx jest cactus-plugin-persistence-ethereum
```

### Generating types from the database schema

- Current setup assume use of Supabase that has utility for generating types from the database schema.
- We use this tool to generate type definitions and store them in `./src/main/typescript/db-client/database.types.ts`
- Upstream instructions: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/generating-types
- Step by step manual on updating the types (must be done after changing the database schema):
  - Install `supabase` package
  - Init and start development supabase server:
    - `npx supabase init`
    - `npx supabase start`
  - Fill in current schema:
    - `psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -a -f src/main/sql/schema.sql` (password: `postgres`)
  - Generate the file with type definitions:
    - `npx supabase gen types typescript --schema public --local > src/main/typescript/db-client/database.types.ts`
  - Cleanup:
    - `npx supabase stop`
    - `rm -rf ./supabase`

#### Insert sample data

- Can be used to test GUI applications without running entire ledger / persistence setup.
- `psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -a -f src/test/sql/insert-test-data.sql` (password: `postgres`)
