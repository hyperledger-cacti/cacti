# `@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-quorum`

This plugin provides `Cactus` a way to interact with Quorum networks. Using this we can perform:
* Deploy Smart-contracts through bytecode.
* Build and sign transactions using different keystores.
* Invoke smart-contract functions that we have deployed on the network.

## Getting Started

Clone the git repository on your local machine. Follow these instructions that will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In the root of the project to install the dependencies execute the command:
```sh
npm run comfigure
```

### Compiling

In the projects root folder, run this command to compile the plugin and create the dist directory:
```sh
npm run tsc
```

## Usage

To use this import public-api and create new **PluginLedgerConnectorQuorum**.
```typescript
  const connector: PluginLedgerConnectorQuorum = new PluginLedgerConnectorQuorum({
    instanceId: uuidV4(),
    rpcApiHttpHost,
    pluginRegistry: new PluginRegistry(),
  });
```
You can make calls through the connector to the plugin API:

```typescript
async invokeContract(req: InvokeContractV1Request):Promise<InvokeContractV1Response>;
async transactSigned(rawTransaction: string): Promise<RunTransactionResponse>;
async transactPrivateKey(req: RunTransactionRequest): Promise<RunTransactionResponse>;
async transactCactusKeychainRef(req: RunTransactionRequest):Promise<RunTransactionResponse>;
async deployContract(req: DeployContractSolidityBytecodeV1Request):Promise<RunTransactionResponse>;
async signTransaction(req: SignTransactionRequest):Promise<Optional<SignTransactionResponse>>;
```

Call example to deploy a contract:
```typescript
const deployOut = await connector.deployContract({
  web3SigningCredential: {
    ethAccount: firstHighNetWorthAccount,
    secret: "",
    type: Web3SigningCredentialType.GETHKEYCHAINPASSWORD,
  },
  bytecode: ContractJson.bytecode,
  gas: 1000000,
});
```
The field "type" can have the following values:
```typescript
enum Web3SigningCredentialType {
    CACTUSKEYCHAINREF = 'CACTUS_KEYCHAIN_REF',
    GETHKEYCHAINPASSWORD = 'GETH_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD',
    PRIVATEKEYHEX = 'PRIVATE_KEY_HEX',
    NONE = 'NONE'
}
```

## Running the tests

To check that all has been installed correctly and that the pugin has no errors, there are two options to run the tests:

* Run this command at the project's root:
```sh
npm run test:plugin-ledger-connector-quorum
```
## Prometheus Exporter

This class creates a prometheus exporter, which scrapes the transactions (total transaction count) for the use cases incorporating the use of Quorum connector plugin.

### Prometheus Exporter Usage
The prometheus exporter object is initialized in the `PluginLedgerConnectorQuorum` class constructor itself, so instantiating the object of the `PluginLedgerConnectorQuorum` class, gives access to the exporter object.
You can also initialize the prometheus exporter object seperately and then pass it to the `IPluginLedgerConnectorQuorumOptions` interface for `PluginLedgerConnectoQuorum` constructor.

`getPrometheusMetricsV1` function returns the prometheus exporter metrics, currently displaying the total transaction count, which currently increments everytime the `transact()` method of the `PluginLedgerConnectorQuorum` class is called.

### Prometheus Integration
To use Prometheus with this exporter make sure to install [Prometheus main component](https://prometheus.io/download/).
Once Prometheus is setup, the corresponding scrape_config needs to be added to the prometheus.yml

```(yaml)
- job_name: 'quorum_ledger_connector_exporter'
  metrics_path: api/v1/plugins/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-quorum/get-prometheus-exporter-metrics
  scrape_interval: 5s
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['{host}:{port}']
```

Here the `host:port` is where the prometheus exporter metrics are exposed. The test cases (For example, packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-quorum/src/test/typescript/integration/plugin-ledger-connector-quorum/deploy-contract/deploy-contract-from-json.test.ts) exposes it over `0.0.0.0` and a random port(). The random port can be found in the running logs of the test case and looks like (42379 in the below mentioned URL)
`Metrics URL: http://0.0.0.0:42379/api/v1/plugins/@hyperledger/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-quorum/get-prometheus-exporter-metrics`

Once edited, you can start the prometheus service by referencing the above edited prometheus.yml file.
On the prometheus graphical interface (defaulted to http://localhost:9090), choose **Graph** from the menu bar, then select the **Console** tab. From the **Insert metric at cursor** drop down, select **cactus_quorum_total_tx_count** and click **execute**

### Helper code

###### response.type.ts
This file contains the various responses of the metrics.

###### data-fetcher.ts
This file contains functions encasing the logic to process the data points

###### metrics.ts
This file lists all the prometheus metrics and what they are used for.

## Running the tests

To check that all has been installed correctly and that the pugin has no errors, there are two options to run the tests:

* Run this command at the project's root:
```sh
npm run test:plugin-ledger-connector-quorum
```
