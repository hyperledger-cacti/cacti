## Remarks

- Plugin requires running Supabase or other database and persistence plugins in order to properly view ledger data.
- Currently, fabric and ethereum based ledgers are supported.

## Getting Started

Clone the git repository on your local machine. Follow these instructions that will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites using yarn

In the root of the project, execute the command to install and build the dependencies. It will also build this GUI front-end component:

```sh
yarn run build
```

### Alternative Prerequisites using npm

In the root of the project, execute the command to install and build the dependencies. It will also build this GUI front-end component:

```sh
npm install
```

### Usage

- Run Supabase instance (see documentation for detailed instructions). For development purposes, you can use our image located in `tools/docker/supabase-all-in-one`.
- Run one or more persistence plugins:
  - [Ethereum](../cacti-plugin-persistence-ethereum)
  - [Fabric] (../cacti-plugin-persistence-fabric)
- Edit [Supabase configuration file](./src/supabase-client.tsx), set correct supabase API URL and service_role key.
- Execute `yarn run start` or `npm start` in this package directory.
- The running application address: http://localhost:3001/ (can be changed in [Vite configuration](./vite.config.ts))

#### Sample Data

- To preview the GUI without running the persistence plugins you can use historic sample data located at `packages/cacti-ledger-browser/src/test/sql/sample-data.sql`.
- Use `psql` tool to import it to your supabase postgres DB instance.
- example:

```bash
psql "postgres://postgres.DB_NAME:DB_PASS@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres" -f src/test/sql/sample-data.sql
```
