# View Requests

- RFC: 03-007
- Authors: Venkatraman Ramakrishna, Sandeep Nishad, Krishnasuri Narayanam, Dhinakaran Vinayagamurthy
- Status: Proposed
- Since: 30-May-2022

## Summary

## Query

Query message is used to define the data that is being requested. This is used in relay-relay and relay-driver communication, where destination relay requests response for this query from source relay, and source relay requests response from the driver identified by the [view address](../../formats/views/addressing.md) provided in this payload. This is different from [NetworkQuery](../communication/relay.md#networkquery) as that message is used by client application at destination to initiate the data sharing query request to the destination relay. This message additionally contains `request_id` generated by the destination relay to uniquely identify and track this query request.

```protobuf
message Query {
  repeated string policy = 1;
  string address = 2;
  string requesting_relay = 3;
  string requesting_network = 4;
  string certificate = 5;
  string requestor_signature = 6;
  string nonce = 7;
  string request_id = 8;
  string requesting_org = 9;
  bool confidential = 10;
}
```

## State

### ViewPayload

Encapsulates either error or the response view of the query request identified by `request_id`. The driver uses this payload to encapsulate the response view or error (depending upon the query response from the ledger) into `ViewPayload` message, and send it to the source relay using the [SendDriverState](../../models/infrastructure/relays.md#api-for-driver) API. Source relay will send the same payload to the destination relay using [SendState](../../models/infrastructure/relays.md#api-for-other-relays) API. The destination relay then stores the state in the database indexed by `request_id`. 

```protobuf
// View represents the response from a remote network
message ViewPayload {
  string request_id = 1;
  oneof state {
    View view = 2;
    string error = 3;
  };
}
```

The `state` either contains a `view` field (which is an instance of [View](./definition.md), if the view/data sharing request was successful), otherwise it consists of an error report.

### RequestState

```protobuf
message RequestState {
  enum STATUS {
    // pending ACK from remote relay
    PENDING_ACK = 0;
    // Received ACK, waiting for data to be sent from remote relay
    PENDING = 1;
    ERROR = 2;
    COMPLETED = 3;
  };
  string request_id = 1;
  STATUS status = 2;
  oneof state {
    View view = 3;
    string error = 4;
  };
}
```

This payload is used for the communication between the destination relay and the client application. When client polls the destination relay for response for the query identified by `request_id`, using [GetState](../../models/infrastructure/relays.md#api-for-application-client) API, passing [GetStateMessage](../communication/relay.md#getstatemessage) as an argument, which contains the `request_id`, the relay returns above payload, which consists of `request_id` (uniquely identifying the query for which the client polled for) and the status of request i.e. one of the following enumerations:
    * `PENDING_ACK`: [Ack](#ack) pending from the remote relay to the [RequestState](../../models/infrastructure/relays.md#api-for-other-relays) API call.
    * `PENDING`: Ack recieved but waiting the response data from remote relay.
    * `ERROR`: signifying error occurred during remote query, and state is the error message.
    * `COMPLETED`: signifying successful completion, and state is the response view, that is an instance of `View` defined [here](./definition.md).

## Ack

In a [data sharing protocol](../../protocols/data-sharing/generic.md) session, `Ack` is sent in response to the following:
* Client app sending `NetworkQuery` to destination relay.
* Relay sending `Query` to source relay.
* Source relay sending `Query` to driver.
* Driver sending `ViewPayload` to the source relay.
* Source relay sending `ViewPayload` to the destination relay.

```protobuf
message Ack {
  enum STATUS {
    OK = 0;
    ERROR = 1;
  };
  STATUS status = 2;
  string request_id = 3;
  // an error can have an associated string
  // this is the best way to represent this in protobuf
  string message = 4;
}
```

Ack `status` is `OK` for positive acknowledgement. For negative acknowledgement, Ack `status` is `ERROR`, and an error message can also be passed in the `message` field. The `request_id` field is used to uniquely track/identify the query for which is Ack is produced for. The `request_id` is same as the one generated by destination relay on receiving the query from client application. The same value for `request_id` is referred in all the protobuf messages (defined above) in a protocol session to uniquely track/identify the query request.
