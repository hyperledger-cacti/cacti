It offers a collection of vendor-neutral and DLT-specific modules, libraries, and SDKs for popular DLTs, and templates to help you configure your networks and adapt your DApps to interoperate with other networks and their DApps for the purposes of carrying out atomic asset swaps, asset transfers, sharing ledger state, and other use cases. Cacti does not require deployment of, or dependence on, separate chains, and therefore is uniquely suited to help private (or permissioned) DLT networks be interoperable while keeping control of their governance and maintaining security and privacy.</p> <p>Cacti is the product of a merger between the pre-existing Cactus and Weaver Lab projects, bringing together two code bases with overlapping as well as complementary feature sets under a common umbrella repository. The core (and shared) design philosophy of Cacti is the enablement of interoperability in a manner that preserves the self-sovereignty of existing networks while providing consensus-driven control over cross-network interactions, does not require modifications to existing DLT stacks, and eschews reliance on third-party chains. Cacti covers the spectrum of generic interoperability modes required to fulfil cross-network transactions, namely asset exchanges, asset transfers, and ledger data sharing.</p> <p>Cacti is built on a modular architecture and supports extensions through the plugin model. It maintains certain core components that are independent of DLTs, and also packages (called connectors or drivers) and libraries for specific DLTs.

The solution to this is not to force all chains to coalesce (i.e., \"a single chain to rule them all\") but rather enable the networks to orchestrate transactions spanning their boundaries without sacrificing security, privacy, or governance autonomy (i.e., self-sovereignty). Hyperledger Cacti offers a family of protocols, modules, libraries, and SDKs, that can enable one network to be interoperable with, and carry out transactions directly with, another while eschewing the need for a central or common settlement chain.

Cross-chain asset exchange is a significant step towards blockchain interoperability. For public blockchains, the most popular application for asset exchange is cryptocurrency exchange. For permissioned blockchains, cross-chain asset exchange can be useful in Delivery Versus Payment (DvP) and cross-border payment scenarios. There exist various protocols designed for asset exchange on public blockchains. However, a widely adopted standard for designing such protocols for permissioned blockchains still does not exist. Moreover, most existing protocols are designed for public blockchains and their suitability to be applied to permissioned blockchains is unclear.</p> <p>In this article, we aim to lay out a set of requirements for designing cross-chain asset exchange protocols between permissioned blockchains. First we present a canonical motivating use case and then list the various patterns that such cases will follow in real-life scenarios. We then present a short survey of existing cross-chain exchange protocols for public blockchains, following which we summarise the building blocks, core mechanisms and security properties commonly involved in the protocol designs. We then analyse the requirements imposed by permissioned blockchains in comparison to public blockchains, and discuss the additional properties with respect to these restrictions.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2021-01-21-cross-chain-asset/#motivation-and-use-case","title":"Motivation and Use-case","text":"<p>In traditional financial markets parties trade assets such as securities and derivatives for cash or other assets. To reduce risk, various clearing and settlement processes and intermediaries are often involved. One form of settlement is a DvP where the transfer of securities is performed only in the event of a corresponding payment. This arrangement reduces principal risk by ensuring that both parties receive their end of the exchange. However, settlement in financial markets are slow and time consuming. It also involves counterparty risks and requires intermediaries.</p> <p>Over the past few years, we have been seeing significant efforts in digitising and tokenising both currencies and securities on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) infrastructures. On the one hand we have seen concerted efforts around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) being added to the landscape of other blockchain based payment networks. On the other hand, we have also seen efforts such as that from the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to replace its current settlement system--Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) with a DLT based platform by 2021.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, a number of central banks have been exploring the potential of performing DvP settlement across a currency ledger and a securities ledger. In this article, we use this as a motivating use-case for our discussions. The scenario involves two decentralised ledgers, namely, a currency ledger and a securities ledger, based on different DLT protocols performing a coordinated transfer of assets in their respective ledgers. Figure 1 depicts this scenario in the context of two organisations--Bank A and Bank B--in which Bank B wants to purchase some securities owned by Bank A and both organisations have accounts on both ledgers. To effect this exchange the following two transactions will have to happen atomically across both networks: i) transfer of payment from Bank B's currency account to Bank A while at the same time ii) the entitlements of the designated securities is transferred from Bank A to Bank B. The scenario would need to guarantee that after the transaction execution, either both parties have their end of the exchange or neither does and that this exchange is performed in a timely manner. </p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1. A typical DvP use-case.</p> <p>Cross-chain transactions involving the movement of assets can generally take the form of either an asset exchange between parties or of value transfer from one network to another. The latter involves a scenario in which an asset in one network is locked or burned and a corresponding asset of similar value is issued in a corresponding network. This process generally involves validators or asset issuers in either or both ends of the network. While there are numerous use cases for this model in permissionless context, in this post we primarily focus on asset exchange scenarios, which are more broadly applicable in enterprise use-cases. Asset exchange scenarios generally involve two users swapping corresponding assets managed by the different networks, as in the example illustrated earlier. In asset exchange scenarios involving only two parties, both parties have accounts on both networks, although this might not be the case for exchanges involving more than two parties or networks.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2021-01-21-cross-chain-asset/#cross-chain-asset-exchange-on-public-blockchains","title":"Cross-Chain Asset Exchange on Public Blockchains","text":"<p>Similar scenarios that involve a pair of transactions being coordinated across distinct blockchains have been studied for public blockchains. One main application area is to enable decentralised exchange across crypto-currency networks. To achieve this, a number of cross-chain asset exchange protocols have been proposed. The original atomic swap protocol was proposed by TierNolan in the Bitcoin Forum. The protocol leverages trusted escrow services on both blockchains and relies on the asset owners for execution. Prestwich later improved the protocol by removing the trusted escrow services and using a smart contract to automatically execute the swap. Both protocols, however, are asymmetric and hence enforce a particular sequence of events. More recently, a group of researchers developed Arwen, which guarantees the symmetricality of the protocol and further eases the asset owners' responsibilities in the protocol execution. </p> <p>We below first discuss the common patterns involved in the protocol design.

This scheme is often used with a specified timeout to provide flexibility for reclaiming locked funds if the exchange does not take place.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fund redeeming: In general, the execution requires a pair of transactions to occur on both blockchains, e.g., from User A to User B on Chain A and from User B to User A on Chain B. When certain conditions are met, the locked funds can be redeemed by, or paid to the respective users. The execution of the exchange can be carried out by users themselves, or through other trusted third parties.

To ensure secure execution of these protocols, their designs usually incorporate economic incentives, together with on-chain punishment schemes. To ensure liveness, these protocols usually leverage group consensus and fault-tolerance.</p> <p>Permissioned blockchains on the other hand require privacy. Additional economic incentives and punishments are often not required besides the existing business relationships and established legal jurisdictions. Therefore, compared to public blockchains, the design of cross-chain asset exchange protocols on permissioned blockchains allows a higher level of centralisation and requires auditability and individual or group accountability for off-chain dispute resolution rather than economic incentives and on-chain punishments. Moreover, as permissioned blockchains themselves offer a higher throughput and faster transaction processing than public blockchains, the asset exchange protocol ideally should not introduce significant processing overheads that limit the transaction processing capability.</p> <p>Therefore, the challenges in designing cross-chain asset exchange protocols for permissioned networks can be summarised as follow: * Permissioned networks are usually confidential by design, thus restricting access for its internal members and external clients. State verification is hard to achieve across distinct permissioned blockchains. Cross-chain asset exchange protocols must therefore incorporate additional mechanisms to overcome these challenges. * Unlike public blockchains, permissioned blockchains derive their security from and the ability to hold parties accountable for their actions. Any party acting maliciously should be identified and penalized during an off-chain dispute resolution process. Thus we can relax some of the constraints of the exchange protocol. For example, we can leverage trusted third-parties instead of having to financially incentivise regular users to participate in running the protocol.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2021-01-21-cross-chain-asset/#additional-properties","title":"Additional Properties","text":"<p>In addition to following the same set of building blocks, core mechanisms and security properties as public protocols, we also identify an additional set of desired properties for permissioned blockchains.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Scalability: Scalability is often restricted by two factors. Firstly, the transaction processing capability of the underlying infrastructures. When a protocol relies on public blockchains, the throughput is consequently limited by the transaction processing of the blockchains themselves. In contrast, some protocols are off-chain, which usually allow faster transaction processing. Secondly, for protocols that involve third parties for fund-locking, such as Xclaim and Dogethereum, the amount of money owned by these third parties limits the number of transaction requests they can process. As permissioned blockchains in general have a higher throughput compared to public blockchains, the protocol design should not trade off scalability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Auditability: Auditability for public blockchains specifies that any party with read right should be able to detect protocol failure. On permissioned blockchains, however, as parties have limited visibility over the ledger state, who can detect protocol failure will most-likely depend on the use-case. In addition, financial regulatory requirements such as AML and CTF might require cross-chain traceability and auditability of exchange transactions (i.e. it should be easy to trace why Alice just transferred Bob $1M on a CBDC network).</p> </li> <li> <p>Accountability: Accountability says faulty parties should be held accountable. This can refer to individual accountability or group accountability. As it is hard to enforce on-chain punishments on permissioned blockchains, the protocol design should at least allow adversaries to be held accountable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compatibility: Compatibility specifies how easy it is to implement the protocol on other blockchain platforms. The protocol design should be generic and not to be limited to particular blockchain platforms.</p> </li> <li> <p>Extensibility: Extensibility specifies how easy it is to extend the protocol to other use cases, for instance, from two parties to multiple parties, or from one particular transaction pattern to other transaction patterns. </p> </li> <li> <p>Privacy: Privacy is usually not automatically guaranteed by public blockchains. For sensitive use-cases, extra mechanisms such as a trusted execution environment (TEE) can be used. Privacy is also of vital importance when it comes to permissioned blockchains. Most existing cross-chain protocols are designed for public blockchains. As the execution of these protocols may require asset owners or third-parties to access states on either blockchain ledger, executing a cross-chain asset exchange can put user privacy at risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Low Cost: As many of the cross-chain exchange protocols involve sending on-chain transactions, the concern over number of transactions and transaction fees arises when the protocol design involves a public blockchain.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"blog/2021-01-21-cross-chain-asset/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>To summarise, in this article we tackle the problem of enabling cross-chain asset exchange on permissioned blockchains and evaluate the different requirements imposed by public blockchains and permissioned blockchains.

The goal being to evaluate the potential of blockchain, these networks were created to manage selected few assets and records. Needless to say, interoperation with other networks was not high on the priority list when such networks were designed and launched.</p> <p>Many of these networks have been successfully validated and put into production. But a consequence of the decision to build limited-scope networks is that the processes they run (through smart contracts) and the assets and records they maintain on their ledgers are stuck in siloes, inaccessible to external entitites and networks. Yet, as we are discovering, processes and assets in such networks are inextricably linked in the real enterprise world. With all of the investment (in time and money) made in existing networks, reeingeneering or merging them will generally be hardsells.

This is true 99% of the time, BUT if you are the only person working on a branch (which is most of time true for a feature/fix branch of yours that you are planning to submit as a PR) then force pushing is not just allowed but necessary to avoid messy git commit logs. The question you need to ask yourself before force pushing is this: Am I going to destroy someone else\u2019s work on the remote branch? If nobody else is working on the branch then the answer is of course no and force push can be used safely. If others are working with you on the branch on the other hand, it is considered polite to ask and warn them in advance prior to force pushing so that they can take the necessary precautions on their side as well.</p> <p>A handy tool to avoid destroying other\u2019s work accidentally is the new(ish) git feature called <code>--force-with-lease</code>: Using <code>git push --force-with-lease</code> instead of vanilla <code>--force</code> is highly recommended: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/312710</p> <p>The rustlang documentation has an excellent write-up and additional links on pretty much everything you need to know. The only difference between their PR requirements and Cactus\u2019 is that we do encourage people referencing github issues in commit messages. Quoting the most relevant parts below (and thanks to the Rust maintainers for this).</p> <p>Pull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change Rust. GitHub itself has some great documentation on using the Pull Request feature. We use the \u201cfork and pull\u201d model described here, where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to bring those changes into the source repository.</p> <p>Please make pull requests against the main branch.</p> <p>Rust follows a no merge policy, meaning, when you encounter merge conflicts you are expected to always rebase instead of merge. E.g. always use rebase when bringing the latest changes from the main branch to your feature branch. Also, please make sure that fixup commits are squashed into other related commits with meaningful commit messages.</p> <p>GitHub allows closing issues using keywords. This feature should be used to keep the issue tracker tidy.</p> <p>Source: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/53702a67e2ae8a404169a0329f6a38d73bf7494d/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests</p> <p>Further reading:</p> <ul> <li> <p>https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-collaborative-development-models</p> </li> <li> <p>https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"cactus/contributing/#pr-checklist-contributordeveloper","title":"PR Checklist - Contributor/Developer","text":"<p>To avoid issues in the future, do not install dependencies globally.

Occassionally maintainers may do the merge/conflict resolution themselves, but do not count on this nor try to make a habit out of relying on the potential kindness.</p> </li> <li> <p>After successful rebasing, take another look at your commit(s). Ideally there should be just one in each pull request, but also on the other hand each commit should be as small, simple and self contained as possible, so there can be cases where it makes sense to submit a PR with multiple commits if for example you also had to change something in the test tooling while implementing a feature (in which case there could be a commit for the feature itself and another for the necessary changes to the test tooling package). What we respectfully ask though is that you try to avoid these situations and submit most of your PRs with a single, self contained commit that does not touch multiple things. This significantly reduces the cognitive load required to review the changes which in turn makes everyone happier: the maintainers will have an easier job reviewing, which means they\u2019ll be doing it faster which will (probably) cause you joy in turn.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Push your changes to your main (or whatever you named your feature branch, that is entirely up to you at the end of the day)</p> </li> <li> <p>Initiate a pull request from your fork to the base repository</p> </li> <li> <p>Remember: Opening a pull request is like saying \u201cHey maintainers, I have this change finalized and ready for you to spend time on reviewing it.\u201d The word <code>finalized</code> here is understood to imply that you are not planning on doing any more changes on the branch apart from when being asked to by the reviewers.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is perfectly acceptable to open a pull request and mark it as <code>draft</code> (a GitHub feature) which then signals to the maintainers that if they have time, they are welcome to look at the change, but it may or may not be in its final form yet so you are not responsible for potential loss of time on their end if the review has to be performed multiple times on account of changes. Once you promote your draft PR to a real one, the comments from the point above apply however.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your pull request contains a significant change, we recommend that you apply the similarly named github label on in it as well. It is okay if you do not do this, if we detect that the change is indeed significant, we will apply the label.

Do note however that indirectly the principle still applies, meaning that any package must not depend on the <code>test-tooling</code> package as an npm <code>dependency</code> but rather it must declare it as a <code>devDependency</code> in the relevant section of the <code>package.json</code> file.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Compatible with the TestAnythingProtocol</p> <ul> <li> <p>The NodeJS implementation of said protocol is in the <code>node-tap</code> npm package:</p> </li> <li> <p>Assertions API of Node TAP</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplest possible test case:</p> <p>const test, { Test } = require(\"tape\"); import * as publicApi from \"../../../main/typescript/public-api\";</p> <p>test(\"Module can be loaded\", (t: Test) =&gt; {    t.ok(publicApi);    t.end(); // yaay, test coverage });</p> </li> <li> <p>An end to end test case showcasing everything in action that is being preached in this document about test automation</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Focus/verify a single bug-fix/feature/etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clearly separated from non-test (aka <code>main</code>) source code.

The maintainers are responsible for reviewing and merging all patches submitted for review, and they guide the overall technical direction of the project within the guidelines established by the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee (TSC).</p> <p>Becoming a Maintainer</p> <p>The project\u2019s maintainers will, from time-to-time, consider adding or removing a maintainer. An existing maintainer can submit a change set to the MAINTAINERS.md file. A nominated contributor may become a maintainer by a three-quarters approval of the proposal by the existing maintainers. Once approved, the change set is then merged and the individual is added to (or alternatively, removed from) the maintainers group.</p> <p>Maintainers may be removed by explicit resignation, for prolonged inactivity (3 or more months), or for some infraction of the code of conduct or by consistently demonstrating poor judgement. A maintainer removed for inactivity should be restored following a sustained resumption of contributions and reviews (a month or more) demonstrating a renewed commitment to the project. We require that maintainers that will be temporarily inactive do so \u201cgracefully\u201d and update other maintainers on their status and time availability rather than appearing to \u201cfall off the face of the earth.\u201d</p> <p>Releases</p> <p>A majority of the maintainers may decide to create a release of Cactus. Any broader rules of Hyperledger pertaining to releases must be followed. Once the project is mature, there will be a stable LTS (long term support) release branch, as well as the main branch for upcoming new features.</p> <p>Making Feature/Enhancement Proposals</p> <p>Code changes that are either bug fixes, direct and small improvements, or things that are on the roadmap (see below) can be issued as PRs in a relatively quick time period, although we recommend creating a Github ticket to track even bugs and small improvements. For more substantial changes, however, a feature/enhancement proposal is required. These proceed through the approval process like typical PRs, and require the same \u201c2 + 1\u201d approval policy for acceptance.</p> <p>In particular, all contributors to the project should have enough time to voice an opinion on feature/enhancement proposals before they are accepted. So the maintainers will determine some \u201ccomment period\u201d between proposal submission and acceptance so that contributors have enough time to voice their opinions.</p> <p>Significant changes can be marked as such via the predefined label with the same name. This is a tool that helps maintainers identify the most important issues/discussions to be had at any given time through the GitHub web interface.</p> <p>To easily access the list of significant changes, navigate to the label: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/labels/Significant_Change</p> <p>We also recommend reading our CONTRIBUTING.md file (https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about contributing.</p> <p>Approving Pull Requests</p> <p>Maintainers designated for review are required to review PRs in a timely manner (all circumstances considered, of course). Any pull request must be reviewed by at least two maintainers, and if a PR is submitted by a maintainer, these two reviewers must be different from the original submitter.</p> <p>The technical requirements for submitting/approving/merging pull requests are further detailed in the CONTRIBUTING.md file where it is laid out in detail how to ensure git commit graph tidiness.</p> <p>Reviewing Pull Requests</p> <p>We are strongly committed to processing pull requests from everyone in a fair manner meaning that pull requests are to be reviewed in order of submission. Reviewing PRs in order of submission does not guarantee nor necessitate accepting/merging said PRs in order of submission since some PRs may require lengthy feedback loops while others may pass the muster without any change requests or feedback at all, depending on the nature of the change being proposed. Security related pull requests may be fast tracked even against the \u201cin order of submission\u201d principle if it appears that a vulnerability makes a pull request a time sensitive issue where the sooner we propagate a fix the better it is.</p> <p>Maintainers Meeting</p> <p>The maintainers hold regular maintainers meetings, which are open to everyone. The purpose of the maintainers meeting is to plan for and review the progress of releases, and to discuss the technical and operational direction of the project.</p> <p>Please see the wiki for maintainer meeting details.</p> <p>One point to mention about meetings is that new feature/enhancement proposals as described above should be presented to a maintainers meeting for consideration, feedback, and acceptance.</p> <p>Roadmap</p> <p>The Cactus maintainers are required to maintain a roadmap. There is a technical roadmap, with all of the issues as they directly relate to code, and a more public-friendly roadmap that anyone can digest. The required features to be implemented will be maintained as issues at the official github repository of Cactus with tag string \u2018for current release\u2019 or \u2018for future release\u2019. The task which is not volunteered to work, will be dispatched to specific contributors following consensus among the majority of maintainers.</p> <p>The technical roadmap is implicitly derived from the Github \u201cmilestones\u201d feature. To access the list of milestones for Cactus use this link: https://github.com/hyperledger/cactus/milestones</p> <p>Communications</p> <p>We use the Cactus email list for long-form communications and RocketChat for short, informal announcements and other communications. We encourage all communication, whenever possible, to be public and in the clear (i.e. rather than sending an email directly to a person or two, send it out to the whole list if it pertains to the project).</p> <p>Future Changes</p> <p>The governance of Cactus may change as the project evolves. In particular, if the project becomes large, we will incorporate tiered maintainership, with top-level maintainers, subprojects, subproject maintainers, release managers, and so forth.

The above JSON needs to be converted to protobuf object of <code>org.hyperledger.cacti.weaver.protos.common.access_control.AccessControl.AccessControlPolicy</code>, using google's protobuf library, and the object is the second argument of above functions (first being the instance of CordaRPCOps).</p> <ul> <li>Verification policies:   Taking the same example as above, an example of a verification policy for a B/L requested by the <code>trade-finance-network</code> from the <code>trade-logistics-network</code> is as follows:   <pre><code>{\n    \"securityDomain\":\"trade-logistics-network\",\n    \"identifiers\":\n        [\n            {\n                \"pattern\":\"tradelogisticschannel:shipmentcc:GetBillOfLading:*\",\n                \"policy\":\n                    {\n                        \"type\":\"Signature\",\n                        \"criteria\":\n                            [\n                                \"ExporterMSP\",\n                                \"CarrierMSP\"\n                            ]\n                    }\n            }\n        ]\n}\n</code></pre>   In this sample, a single verification policy rule is specified for data views coming from <code>trade-logistics-network</code>: it states that the data returned by the <code>GetBillOfLading</code> query made to the <code>shipmentcc</code> chaincode on the <code>tradelogisticschannel</code> channel requires as proof two signatures, one from a peer in the organization whose MSP ID is <code>ExporterMSP</code> and another from a peer in the organization whose MSP ID is <code>CarrierMSP</code>.</li> </ul> Notes If the remote network is built on Corda, the resource specified in the access control policy can be used here as the <code>pattern</code>, with different node names specified in the <code>criteria</code>. <p>You need to record this policy rule on your Corda network's vault by invoking Corda sdk's function <code>VerificationPolicyManager.createVerificationPolicyState(proxy, verificationPolicyProto)</code>, where <code>proxy</code> is an instance of <code>CordaRPCOps</code> as described in previous sections, and <code>verificationPolicyProto</code> is an object of protobuf <code>org.hyperledger.cacti.weaver.protos.common.verification_policy.VerificationPolicyOuterClass.VerificationPolicy</code>. You can examine the full proto structure here. (Google's protobuf library can be used to convert above JSON to protobuf object.)</p> Notes For any cross-network data request, make sure an access control policy is recorded in the source network (<code>trade-logistics-network</code> in the above example) and a corresponding verification policy is recorded in the destination network (<code>trade-finance-network</code> in the above example) before any relay request is triggered. <ul> <li>Foreign network security domain (membership) configuration:   Run the following procedure (pseudocode) to record security domain configuration for every foreign network you wish your Corda network to interoperate with (you will need to collect the identity service URLs for all the foreign networks first):   <pre><code>for each foreign network:\n    send an HTTP GET request to the network's identity service (using 'curl' or 'wget' from a shell script or equivalent programming language APIs).\n    convert the response string to protobuf object of 'org.hyperledger.cacti.weaver.protos.common.membership.MembershipOuterClass.Membership'.\n    invoke 'MembershipManager.createMembershipState(proxy, membershipProto)' or 'MembershipManager.updateMembershipState(proxy, membershipProto)' on Corda sdk.\n</code></pre>   As in the above two cases, use <code>createMembershipState</code> to record a confiuration for the first time for a given <code>securityDomain</code> and <code>updateMembershipState</code> to overwrite a configuration.</li> </ul> Notes Security domain configurations (organization lists and their certificate chains) for any Fabric/Corda network are subject to change, so you should run the above procedure periodically in a loop. <p>Your Corda network is now up and running with the necessary Weaver components, and your network's vault is bootstrapped with the initial configuration necessary for cross-network interactions!</p>"},{"location":"weaver/getting-started/enabling-weaver-network/fabric/","title":"Hyperledger Fabric","text":"<p>After testing the Weaver interoperation mechanisms on basic sample networks, you may be interested in finding out how you can equip an existing real network, whether in development or in production, to exercise these mechanisms.

But Weaver's Fabric Interoperation Node SDK offers various helper functions to ease this process and keep the adaptation to a minimum, as we wil see later in this document. Finally, an identity service must be offered by the network to expose its CAs' certificate chains to foreign networks, thereby laying the basis for interoperation.

The following code sample illustrates this (the Golang equivalent is left to the reader): <pre><code>const ihelper = require('@hyperledger/cacti-weaver-sdk-fabric').InteroperableHelper;\nconst interopcc = &lt;handle-to-fabric-interop-chaincode&gt;;   // Use Fabric SDK functions: (new Gateway()).getNetwork(...).getContract(&lt;fabric-interop-chaincode-id&gt;)\nconst keyCert = await ihelper.getKeyAndCertForRemoteRequestbyUserName(&lt;wallet&gt;, &lt;user-id&gt;);      // Read key and certificate for &lt;user-id&gt; from wallet (get handle using Fabric SDK Wallets API)\n// Collect view addresses for relay requests in the context of an interop flow\ninteropJSONs.push({\n    NetworkID: 'trade-logistics-network',\n    RemoteEndpoint: &lt;trade-logistics-relay-url[:&lt;port&gt;],      // Replace with remote network's relay address and port\n    ChannelID: 'tradelogisticschannel',\n    ChaincodeID: 'shipmentcc',\n    ChaincodeFunc: 'GetBillOfLading',\n    ccArgs: [ &lt;shipment-reference&gt; ],     // Replace &lt;shipment-reference&gt; with a value that can be used to look up the right B/L\n    Sign: true\n});\nconst indices = [ 1 ];\n// Trigger an end-to-end interoperation (data sharing) protocol\n// Send a request to a foreign network via your relay, receive the response and submit a transaction to a local chaincode\nconst flowResponse = await ihelper.interopFlow(\n    interopcc,\n    'trade-finance-network',\n    {\n        channel: 'tradefinancechannel',\n        contractName: 'letterofcreditcc',\n        ccFunc: 'RecordBillOfLading',\n        ccArgs: [ &lt;shipment-reference&gt; , '' ]\n    },\n    &lt;org-msp-id&gt;,                         // Replace with this Layer-2 application's organization's MSP ID\n    &lt;trade-finance-relay-url&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;],   // Replace with local network's relay address and port\n    indices,\n    interopJSONs,\n    keyCert,\n    &lt;endorsingOrgs&gt;,        // List of orgs to submit transaction to local i.e. trade logistics network\n    false,                  // Boolean flag to indicate whether return without submit transaction to local i.e. trade logistics network\n    false,                  // Boolean flag indicating no TLS communication with relay\n    [],                     // Keep it empty when TLS is disabled\n    &lt;confidential-flag&gt;,    // Boolean flag to indicate whether to use to end-to-end encryption\n);\n// List of errors to check for\nif (!flowResponse.views || flowResponse.views.length === 0 || !flowResponse.result || flowResponse.views.length !== argIndices.length) {\n    throw &lt;error&gt;;\n}\n</code></pre> Let us understand this code snippet better. The structure in lines 20-25 specifies the local chaincode transaction that is to be triggered after remote data (view) has been requested and obtained via relays. The function <code>RecordBillOfLading</code> expects two arguments as specified in line 24: the first is the common shipment reference that is used by the letter of credit in <code>trade-finance-network</code> and the bill of lading in <code>trade-logistics-network</code>, and the second is the bill of lading contents. When the <code>interopFlow</code> function is called, this argument is left blank because it is supposed to be filled with contents obtained from a view request. The array list <code>indices</code>, which is passed as an argument to <code>interopFlow</code> therefore contains the index value <code>1</code> (line 14), indicating which argument ought to be substituted  with view data. The <code>interopJSONs</code> array correspondingly contains a list of view addresses that are to be supplied to the relay. The <code>&lt;confidential-flag&gt;</code> if set to <code>true</code> will enable end-to-end confidentiality, i.e. payload will be encrypted from <code>trade-finance-network</code>'s Weaver chaincode, and will be decrypted in SDK (i.e. Layer-2 client application) at <code>trade-logistics-network</code>, but relays and drivers in between will not be able to see the payload. By default this flag is set to <code>false</code>.</p> Notes A local chaincode invocation may require multiple view requests to different networks, which is why <code>indices</code> and <code>interopJSONs</code> are arrays; they therefore must have the same lengths. <p>The rest of the code ought to be self-explanatory. Values are hardcoded for explanation purposes, but you can refactor the above code by reading view addresses corresponding to chaincode invocations from a configuration file.</p> <p>Enabling TLS: By default, the TLS is set to false in <code>interopFlow</code>, i.e. disabled. But if you want to enable TLS, can pass additional parameters to the <code>interopFlow</code> function as follows: <pre><code>const flowResponse = await ihelper.interopFlow(\n    interopcc,\n    'trade-finance-network',\n    {\n        channel: 'tradefinancechannel',\n        contractName: 'letterofcreditcc',\n        ccFunc: 'RecordBillOfLading',\n        ccArgs: [ &lt;shipment-reference&gt; , '' ]\n    },\n    &lt;org-msp-id&gt;,                         // Replace with this Layer-2 application's organization's MSP ID\n    &lt;trade-finance-relay-url&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;],   // Replace with local network's relay address and port\n    indices,\n    interopJSONs,\n    keyCert,\n    &lt;endorsingOrgs&gt;,            // List of orgs to submit transaction to in trade logistics network\n    false,                  // Boolean flag to indicate whether return without submit transaction to local i.e. trade logistics network\n    true,                       // Boolean indication TLS is enabled.\n    &lt;tlsCACertPathsForRelay&gt;,   // list of CA certificate file paths\n);\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"weaver/getting-started/enabling-weaver-network/fabric/#for-asset-exchange_1","title":"For Asset Exchange","text":"<p>Let's take an example of asset exchange between <code>Alice</code> and <code>Bob</code>, where Bob wants to purchase an asset of type <code>Gold</code> with id <code>A123</code> from <code>Alice</code> in <code>BondNetwork</code> in exchange for <code>200</code> tokens of type <code>CBDC01</code> in <code>TokenNetwork</code>.</p> <p><code>Alice</code> needs to select a secret text (say <code>s</code>), and hash it (say <code>H</code>) using say <code>SHA512</code>, which will be used to lock her asset in <code>BondNetwork</code>. At the place in your application where an asset exchange is to be initiated, you need to add code to enable Alice to lock the non-fungible asset using hash <code>H</code> and timeout duration of 10 minutes: <pre><code>import { AssetManager, HashFunctions } from '@hyperledger/cacti-weaver-sdk-fabric'\n\nconst hash = HashFunctions.SHA512();    // Create Hash instance of one of the supported Hash Algorithm\nhash.setSerializedHashBase64(H);        // Set the Hash\nconst timeout = Math.floor(Date.now()/1000) + 10 * 60;\n\nconst bondContract = &lt;handle-to-fabric-application-chaincode-in-bond-network&gt;;\n\nconst result = await AssetManager.createHTLC(\n    bondContract,\n    \"Gold\",             // Asset ID\n    \"A123\",             // Asset Type\n    bobCertificate,     // Certificate of Bob in Bond Network\n    hash,                  // Hash generated by Alice using her secret s\n    timeout,            // Timeout in epoch for 10 mins from current time\n    null                // Optional callback function to be called after the asset is locked\n);\nlet bondContractId = result.result; // Unique ID for this asset exchange contract in BondNetwork\n</code></pre></p> Notes Note that 'Alice' and 'Bob' and the asset specifics can be parameterized in the above code, which can be reused for arbitrary asset exchange scenarios in your business workflow.

To reduce risk, various clearing and settlement processes and intermediaries are often involved. One form of settlement is a DvP (delivery versus payment) where the transfer of securities is performed only in the event of a corresponding payment. This arrangement reduces principal risk by ensuring that both parties receive their end of the exchange. However, settlement in financial markets are slow and time consuming. It also involves counterparty risks and requires intermediaries.</p> <p>Over the past few years, we have been seeing significant efforts in digitising and tokenising both currencies and securities on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) infrastructures. On the one hand we have seen concerted efforts around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) being added to the landscape of other blockchain based payment networks. On the other hand, we have also seen efforts such as that from the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to replace its current settlement system--Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) with a DLT based platform by 2021.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, a number of central banks have been exploring the potential of performing DvP settlement across a currency ledger and a securities ledger. In this use case, we use this as a motivating use-case for our discussions. The scenario involves two decentralised ledgers, namely, a currency ledger and a securities ledger, based on different DLT protocols performing a coordinated transfer of assets in their respective ledgers.</p> <p>The figure below depicts this scenario in the context of two organisations--Org-A and Org-B. Org-B wants to purchase some securities owned by Org-A and both organisations have accounts on both ledgers. This scenario is simplified and leaves out a number of additional real world processes. For instance, the buyer and seller for securities need to discover each other and agree on the price and terms of a sale. In addition, an offer to sell securities might be fulfilled by multiple buyers taking smaller portions of the amount for sale. Such capabilities are often offered by centralised exchanges that offer capabilities such as order books and matching engines to address these needs. In this scenario we instead focus on the settlement process that follows such steps, once the parties of an exchange and the price of the exchange for an asset are determined.</p> <p>To effect the settlement of this exchange between Org-A and Org-B, the following two transactions will have to happen atomically across both networks: i) transfer of payment from Org-B's currency account in the CBDC ledger to Org-A while at the same time ii) the entitlements of the designated securities are transferred from Org-A to Org-B. The scenario would need to guarantee that after the transaction execution, either both parties have their end of the exchange or neither does and that this exchange is performed in a timely manner.</p> <p></p> <p>The settlement of the exchange of securities from Org-A to Org-B in the Financial Securities Network for a simultaneous payment from Org-B to Org-A in the CBDC network is coordinated by Weaver using Hashed Time Lock Contracts. This protocol essentially has three phases:</p> <ul> <li>Fund locking: To initialise an asset exchange, it is common for one or both parties to first lock up funds with a fund-withholding party on his or her own blockchain. Temporary fund locking ensures the locked fund cannot be used for other purposes while the exchange is being executed. This scheme is often used with a specified timeout to provide flexibility for reclaiming locked funds if the exchange does not take place.</li> <li>Fund redeeming: In general, the execution requires a pair of transactions to occur on both blockchains, e.g., from Org-A to Org-B on the FSN ledger and from Org-B to Org-A in CBDC ledger. When certain conditions are met, the locked funds can be redeemed by, or paid to the respective users. The execution of the exchange can be carried out by users themselves, or through other trusted third parties. These trusted third parties can be stand-alone parties that are not otherwise involved in both blockchains, or part of either blockchain.\u00a0</li> <li>Refund: For protocols that are initialised with a temporary fund-locking, the locked funds can usually be reclaimed by the initial owner after a specified timeout, if a redemption has not occurred.\u00a0</li> </ul> <p>The process proceeds as follows, and is further illustrated in the figure below:</p> <ol> <li>Org-A locks its securities in FSN ledger: Org-A first creates some secret S, known only to it and locks its securities using the hash of S. The securities are configured to redeemable by Org-B if it presents S within some specified time threshold.</li> <li>Org-B locks payments tokens in CBDC ledger: Org-B, observes that Org-A has locked its securities in the FSN network and does a corresponding lock of its payment tokens with the hash of S, used by Org-A in locking its securities. The payment tokens are redeemable only by Org-A, if it submits a transaction that reveals S within a specified time.</li> <li>Org-A checks Org-B's contract in CBDC ledger: Org-A checks the CBDC network to ensure that the payments tokens are locked by Org-B.</li> <li>Org-A claims payments in CBDC ledger: Org-A submits a transaction to claim the payments tokens, by revealing the secret S.</li> <li>Org-B claims securities in FSN ledger: Org-B observes that the value of S has been revealed in the CBDC network by Org-A in step 4, and submits a transaction to claim the securities in the FSN network using the revealed secret.</li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"weaver/user-stories/global-trade/","title":"Global Trade","text":"<p>The examples in this page cover the global trade application domain and the data sharing pattern.</p>"},{"location":"weaver/user-stories/global-trade/#process-overview","title":"Process Overview","text":"<p>At its simplest, international trade is about a party in one country buying certain goods from a party in another country. Because the goods cross international boundaries, the buyer is called an importer and the seller is called an exporter. For the same reason, this process is not as straightforward as, say, purchasing an item from a retailer.</p> <p>The exporting of goods in most countries is governed by a host of regulatory provisions and authorities, making the very act of clearing the sale and getting the goods ready for shipment a complex one. Further, an exporter must rely on one or more carriers to move the shipment from source to destination while managing all of the risks this entails.</p> <p>But this only covers the shipping logistics. The trading parties, i.e., the exporter and importer, both face what is called counterparty risk, or the hazard of giving something up without a guarantee of receiving something in return. If the exporter ships the goods first, the importer may renege on the payment. And if the importer mmakes the payment first, the exporter may renege on the shipment. To hedge against this risk, sophisticated process of trade finance have evolved over centuries, with banks or other financial institutions providing the sorts of guarantees (in exchange for fees) that enable exporters and importers to safely conduct trades.</p> <p>Permissioned blockchains are a great fit to manage such trade scenarios, involving multiple independent entities and no governing authorities, using smart contracts.

It then hands the consignment over to the carrier. In a real life export scenario, this process involves a lot of documentation and approval cycles, but we are going to ignore all of those here. The carrier supplies documents certifying its possession of the consignment and the contents within it. The bill of lading (B/L for short) is one of these documents, and though there may be others, like a packing list and a shipping manifest, we only need one to motivate interoperability. So we will keep it simple and assume that the carrier simply uploads a B/L.

Think of the seller as our coffee plantation owner in the logistics network, the buyer as Starbucks, and the banks as Bank of America and HSBC Bank, for example.</p> <p></p> <p>Traders and banks use a variety of mechanisms to mitigate counterparty risk, one of them being open accounting, used in networks like We.Trade. We pick the popular letter of credit (L/C for short) instrument for our trade finance story as this exemplifies the inherent link between logistics and finance (we will see this later). The process begins with the buyer requesting an L/C from its bank for a given trade, referring to the id of the purchase order generated earlier. In simplest terms, an L/C is a promise made by a bank to pay a certain amount to the bearer of certain documents associated with a given export shipment. In our scenario, the buyer's bank issues an L/C promising to pay the seller (through its bank) the amount due to it upon production of a valid B/L. This L/C proposal is recorded on the ledger, and subsequently approved by the seller's bank. After the seller uploads a B/L, the seller's bank is allowed to register a request for payment. This leaves a payment obligation for the buyer's bank on the ledger, which is where we will conclude the scenario, as the actual payment is carried out through a separate process on a different network.</p> <p>Note that the seller is supposed to produce and record a valid B/L in Step 4.</p>"},{"location":"weaver/user-stories/global-trade/#linking-finance-with-logistics","title":"Linking Finance with Logistics","text":"<p>It is obvious that the logistics and finance processes are linked. Both begin with references to a common purchase order id and both involve bills of lading. Let us focus on the B/L, as it exemplifies a common pattern in these kinds of business networks: that of being generated in one network and being used in another. Because thee are two separate networks, the trade finance network depends on the seller to upload a B/L. But here, we encounter another kind of hazard, one we discussed earlier in the challenges section. The seller has an incentive to produce a fake bill of lading in order to get paid for goods it may not have dispatched and may have no intention of dispatching. In the present setup, the trade finance network as a whole, nor the buyer or its bank, has visibility into the trade logistics network's ledger, and hence have to trust the seller's word.</p> <p>This hazard can be avoided if the networks are interoperable, and can share data with each other. Specifically, if the trade logistics network can share a B/L recorded on its ledger institutionally with the trade finance network. To see how this works, see the diagram below, which contains both the networks and merges their flows.</p> <p></p> <p>Step 4 in the isolated trade finance network is now replaced with an interoperation step (Step 10) whereby the trade finance network obtains a B/L from the trade logistics network via a data-sharing protocol. This avoids the hazard of having to depend on an unreliable seller to supply a valid B/L. But it is not enough for the trade logistics network to share B/L data. It must also share some proof or evidence that the B/L is presently on record in its shared ledger.</p> <p>Note: in general, an interoperation mechanism for data sharing must communicate data as well as an associated proof that can be independently verified by every memebr of the receiving network.</p>"},{"location":"weaver/user-stories/global-trade/#extending-the-scenario","title":"Extending the Scenario","text":"<p>The above example conforms to how the logistics and finance processes work today. Letters of credit typically specify bills of lading among the lists of documents that must be supplied to claim a payment.

But in real life, there is a need to track imports and exports carefully to ensure that no regulations are broken, and secondarily, to avoid wasted effort. Therefore, we can envision trade logistics networks requiring some evidence of the financial arrangements of a trade before it allows a seller and a carrier to carry out with the shipping process.</p> <p>The process augmentation is illustrated in the figure below with the insertion of a new Step 6 between the booking and the creation of a shipping consignment.</p> <p></p> <p>Like Step 11 (Step 10 in the earlier figure), this is a data-sharing interoperation step where the L/C proposed and accepted on the trade finance network's ledger is copied to the trade logistics network's ledger. (As with the B/L sharing, proof of the L/C ledger record must accompany L/C data.) In this new process, the trade logistics network will not waste time processing shipments that do not have a backing L/C guarantee from the trade finance network.</p> <p>Note that in the interoperation steps, the artifact being shared by one network with another (B/L or L/C) does not have to be copied verbatim to the receiving network's ledger. The process incorporates transformations carried out through smart contract transactions occurring through their networks' native consensus mechanisms.</p>"},{"location":"weaver/user-stories/global-trade/#vision-network-of-networks","title":"Vision: Network of Networks","text":"<p>The promise of blockchain was a more decentralized yet trustworthy internet, but as we saw earlier, networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum may not fulfill that promise, largely because they have technical limitations when it comes to performance and scaling, privacy preservation, and auditability. At the same time, private blockchain networks are here to stay, and they do overcome these technical limitations, albeit at smaller scale. In the longer term, a more sustainable and achievable vision will be to allow private networks to exist while possessing the means to interoperate with other private networks. The interlinking of a trade logistics network with a trade finance network was just a sample. There is more aspects to an international trade scenario: more networks and more cross-network dependencies. But as long as we can institute mechanisms to link two networks directly for data-sharing, we can extrapolate our two-network scenario into a network-of-networks scenario.</p> <p>To show how this will work, we will add two more networks to the mix. Business networks exist to track the quality and health of perishable goods from the production source to the end retailer. These networks complement networks like Trade Lens, which manage the long-distance shipping that occurs in the middle but have no visibiity into the goods before consignment creation or after delivery at the destination by the carrier. To track goods at either ends is the function of networks like IBM Food Trust, which would be ideal for the coffee shipment example we used earlier. A separate aspect of our trade scenario is the actual payment a buyer makes to the seller. Our trade finance network ends by recording a payment obligation, but the transfer of money needs to occur on a separate payment network, like, for example, the Stellar Network.</p> <p>The figure below presents our vision for how cross-network data sharing can help smoothen and simplify all aspects of global trade despite the fact that different sub-processes occur on independent private networks.</p> <p></p> <p>The Food Tracking Network is loosely inspired by IBM Food Trust and the Payments Network loosely inspired by Stellar.</p> <ul> <li>The seller and buyer, as the trading parties, belong to the food tracking network. The process in this network begins with a registration of a purchase order, following which perishable goods (think coffee seeds, for example) are tracked from farms to a warehouse where a shipping consignment is created. Whenever the carier delivers the shipment, the fact of delivery is recorded as is the condition of the goods within.</li> <li>The payment network has the buyer's and seller's bank as members. Action in this network is triggered by the buyer's bank making a payment, or a monetary transfer, to the seller's bank. Both banks have accounts in this network and the payment succeeds or fails depending on available account balance.</li> </ul> <p>There are two parallel timelines starting at Step 17:</p> <ul> <li>One involves the trade finance network and the payments network (Steps 17-20). Step 18 contains both \"Make Payment\" and \"Receive Payment\" as these actions are supposed to occur atomically within the payments network. These pertain to the fulfilment of the payment promised to the seller by the buyer.</li> <li>Another involves the trade logistics network and the food tracking network (Steps 17-19). These pertain to the tracking of goods after dispatch and confirmation of their subsequent delivery and condition.</li> </ul> <p>You may notice we have augmented the trade logistics and trade finance processes as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Step 17 in the trade logistics network illustrates a sequence of transactions, each recording the location and condition of the goods in transit at periodic intervals. We assume that this information can be procured using sensors deployed with the consignment.</li> <li>Step 20 in the trade finance network results in the cancelling of the payment obligation recorded by the seller's bank in Step 17 within that network (\"Request Payment\"), thereby concluding the trade instance associated with the purchase order id generated in Step 1.</li> </ul> <p>The data-sharing interoperation steps are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Step 3: The trade finance network fetches a purchase order from the food tracking network before permitting an L/C request to be made.</li> <li>Step 8: The trade logistics network fetches an L/C from the trade finance network before permitting a consignment to be created.</li> <li>Step 9: The food tracking network fetches a consignment booking record and an associated L/C from the trade logistics network before permitting tracking of goods from the source to the shipping warehouse.</li> <li>Step 11: The trade logistics network fetches tracking information indicating delivery of goods to the warehouse before permitting a consignment to be created.</li> <li>Step 16: The trade finance network fetches a B/L from the trade logistics network before permitting the seller's bank to register a payment request.</li> <li>Step 18: This is a recurring step, in each instance of which the food tracking network fetches location and condition information for a given consignment from the trade logistics network, and does not permit the confirmation of consignment delivery and the integrity of the goods within until the shipment reaches its destination and its condition meets the required standard.</li> <li>Step 19: The trade finance network gets confirmation of payment (from buyer's account to seller's account) from the payments network.</li> </ul> <p>To summarize, internationally traded goods can be tracked from a farm in one country to a retailer in another, the goods can be exported and shipped with all regulations complied with, financial guarantees can be put in place to safeguard the trading parties, and cross-border payments can be processed seamlessly and in a trustworthy manner. But this requires a combination of private blockchain networks willing to share data with each other and also have the ability to verify the authenticity of received data. We hope this scenario makes the motivation for data-sharing interoperation mechanisms perfectly clear.</p>"},{"location":"weaver/user-stories/legacy-integration/","title":"Legacy Integration","text":"<p>A standard for self-contained messages respresenting state in distributed ledgers, along with proofs of validity, enables interoperability with legacy enterprise applications.

In the absence of central coordinating and law-enforcing authorities at the world level, various ad hoc processes have been created and refined over centuries by merchants, financiers, and regulators, to manage complex supply-chain logistics and cross-border financing that underpin global trade. These processes exist to ensure that parties can hedge their risks, mitigate possibilities for non-compliance, and ship goods from one location to another while complying with regulatory guidelines.</p> <p>Multiple networks have emerged to handle trade processes limited in scope. There exist networks to handle trade logistics (like TradeLens, built on Hyperledger Fabric), food tracking (IBM Food Trust, built on Hyperledger Fabric), trade finance (like We.Trade, built on Hyperledger Fabric, and Marco Polo, built on R3 Corda), cross-border payments, and know-your-customer, or KYC, processes. An end-to-end trade scenario, involving shipment of goods, financing commitments, documentation, shipping, tracking, and payments, will rely on many or all of these networks. Interoperation will help us overcome this fragmentation and lack of visibility of one network into another, and enable trustworthy and efficient trades at global scale using blockchain technology.

They have enabled enterprises to harness the innovation of public blockchains, while adhering to the privacy, confidentiality and regulatory constraints that businesses operate under. Permissioned DLTs offer enterprises an infrastructure for managing inter-firm asset, data and business workflow, without the need for a central intermediary that introduces additional sources of risk. Businesses are able to transact directly while reducing counter-party risk and mitigating the need for costly and time-consuming dispute resolution processes, often involving legal and judicial systems. Thus far, the application of this technology has enabled digitisation and disintermediation of many entrenched industry processes, resulting in significant improvements in efficiency, transparency, risk and fraud.</p> <p>For practical reasons, the adoption of permissioned blockchains has thus far been driven through use-cases.

This use-case driven approach to blockchain adoption is creating a proliferation of niche and isolated networks that are quickly becoming data and value silos. In addition, these use-cases often represent a slice of a complex end-to-end business process.
