# Sample DLT Applications

This folder houses implementations of various applications, ranging from toys to production-grade, on different DLTs that can be used to illustrate one or more interoperation scenario (i.e., protocol).

Presently, we have implemented a simple CorDapp for testing purposes [here](./corda-simple-application).

A new subfolder must be created here for every distinct self-contained application.
