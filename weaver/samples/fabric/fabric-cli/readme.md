## Setup

| Notes |
|:------|
| If you are using a linux system make sure that `lib64` is installed |
| Tested on Node v11.14.0 to v16.0.0; requires Node >= 11.14.0 <= 16.0.0 |

The Fabric CLI can be configured either to depend on the published Weaver SDK or the locally built version.

### Using Published Weaver SDK

The `fabric-cli` depends on the npm package `@hyperledger-labs/weaver-fabric-interop-sdk`. To pull this package from Github, run the following steps:
1) Create a Personal Access Token from Github with read access to packages. Refer [Creating a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for help. \
2) Create a copy of `.npmrc.template` as `.npmrc`. \
3) Replace <personal-access-token> in copied `.npmrc` file with your personal access token. \
4) Run `npm install` to check if it is working before testing/deployment.

To install package dependencies, run:
```
make build
```

### Using Locally Built Weaver SDK

Make sure that the [protos-js](../../../common/protos-js) and [weaver-fabric-interop-sdk](../../../sdks/fabric/interoperation-node-sdk) have been built already according to the given instructions.

To install package dependencies, run:
```
make build-local
```

## Configuration

Set up `.env` by copying across the `.env.template` and updating the values

Set up `config.json` by adding the connection profile and relay port for each network. (Can be set with env variable `CONFIG_PATH`)

(Editing of the env and config can be done via the CLI with the `fabric-cli env set` and `fabric-cli config set` commands)

## Running the Fabric-CLI

Run:
```
./bin/fabric-cli [commands-and-parameters]
```

To view list of commands and associated parameters, run:
```
./bin/fabric-cli -h
```

## Running fabric-cli in a Docker container

Set up `.npmrc` by copying across the `.npmrc.template` and updating the values as specified [earlier](#using-published-weaver-sdk).

Run `make build-image` to build fabric-cli docker image.

Then run `docker-compose up -d` to start fabric-cli container.

Then run `docker exec -it fabric-cli bash`, to open interactive shell for fabric-cli, where regular fabric-cli calls can be made.

Setting env is not required inside docker, as env variables are already declared, so next steps would be:
* `./bin/fabric-cli config set-file $CONFG_PATH`
* `./bin/fabric-cli configure all network1 network2`.


## Example Invoke

To record a key `test` with the value `teststate` via the `simplestate` contract deployed on the `mychannel` channel in `network1`, run:
```
$ ./bin/fabric-cli chaincode invoke mychannel simplestate create '["test", "teststate"]' --local-network=network1
```
To now query the value of the the `test` key, run:
```
$ ./bin/fabric-cli chaincode query mychannel simplestate read '["test"]' --local-network=network1
```

NOTE: Use the `--help` flag with any command to view examples and usage.

## Environment Variables
- `DEFAULT_CHANNEL` (OPTIONAL) The default channel used by the CLI when invoking chaincode on a network.
- `DEFAULT_CHAINCODE`(OPTIONAL) The default chaincode id used by the CLI when invoking chaincode on a network.
- `MEMBER_CREDENTIAL_FOLDER`(OPTIONAL) The folder where network configurations will be stored and pulled from when generating network config and loading the chaincode.
- `CONFIG_PATH`(OPTIONAL) Path to the configuration file used by the CLI when creating network credentials and communicating with the relays.

## Configuration file (required)

The configuration file is used by the CLI when generating credentials to communicate with the network as well as the endpoint used to communicate with the relay. Each network can specify a unique relay and connection profile.

Example config:
```
{
  "network1": {
    "connProfilePath": "",
    "relayEndpoint": "",
    "mspId": "",
    "channelName": "",
    "chaincode": ""
  },
  "network2": {
    "connProfilePath": "",
    "relayEndpoint": "",
    "mspId": "",
    "channelName": "",
    "chaincode": ""
  }
}
```

## Data Sharing

Examples of cross-network queries (via relays) are as follows (the last part of the command is a view address, and you will see the remote view being logged to the console):
- Fabric network `network1` requesting a view from Fabric network `network2`
  ```bash
  ./bin/fabric-cli interop --local-network=network1 --requesting-org=Org1MSP localhost:9083/network2/mychannel:simplestate:Read:Arcturus
  ```
- Fabric network `network1` requesting a view from Corda network `Corda_network`
  ```bash
  ./bin/fabric-cli interop --local-network=network2 --sign=true --requesting-org=Org1MSP localhost:9081/Corda_Network/localhost:10006#com.cordaSimpleApplication.flow.GetStateByKey:H --debug=true
  ```
- Both of the above examples assume an insecure (plaintext) gRPC connection with the local network's relay. If the relay is TLS-enabled, you will need to specify the server's TLS CA certificates as follows:
  ```bash
  ./bin/fabric-cli interop --local-network=network1 --requesting-org=Org1MSP --relay-tls=true --relay-tls-ca-files=ca_cert.pem localhost:9083/network2/mychannel:simplestate:Read:Arcturus
  ./bin/fabric-cli interop --local-network=network1 --sign=true --requesting-org=Org1MSP --relay-tls=true --relay-tls-ca-files=ca_cert1.pem:ca_cert2.pem localhost:9081/Corda_Network/localhost:10006#com.cordaSimpleApplication.flow.GetStateByKey:H --debug=true
  ```
  * The `--relay-tls` switch indicates whether or not the local network relay requires a TLS connection
  * The `--relay-tls-ca-files` switch indicates the path to the relay server's TLS CA certificates. Specify a colon-separated list if there are more than one.
- Fabric network `network1` requesting a view from Fabric network `network2` with the view contents confidential between the `network1` client and the `network2` peers
  ```bash
  ./bin/fabric-cli interop --local-network=network1 --requesting-org=Org1MSP --e2e-confidentiality=true localhost:9083/network2/mychannel:simplestate:Read:Arcturus
  ```


## Asset Exchange

Below are the steps to exercise asset exchange using the `fabric-cli` tool.
1. Spin up both `network1` and `network2` with interoperation chaincode installed along with the `simpleasset` application by navigating to the `tests/network-setups/fabric/dev` folder and running either
   ```bash
   make start-interop CHAINCODE_NAME=simpleasset
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   make start-interop-local CHAINCODE_NAME=simpleasset
   ```
   depending on whether you are using pre-built Github packages or using local builds from this clone of the repository.
2. You can use the `fabric-cli` executable in the `bin` folder (for the executable built using Node.js) or the one built using the [Golang version](../go-cli/bin/fabric-cli) after running `make build-local` [here](../go-cli).
3. If a `config.json` (or equivalent, as set in the `CONFIG_PATH` property in `.env`) doesn't exist, create one by making a copy of `config.template.json`. In the `config.json`, set the `chaincode` field in both the `network1` and `network2` sections to `simpleasset`.
4. Run the below script that performs: setting the enviroment, adding the users `Alice` and `Bob` to both the networks and finally adding the non-fungible (i.e., bonds) and fungible (i.e., tokens) assets into the accounts of `Alice` and `Bob`.
   ```bash
   ./scripts/initAsset.sh
   ```
3. Check the status of the assets owned by `Alice` and `Bob` in the two networks `network1` and `network2`, by running
   ```bash
   ./scripts/getAssetStatus.sh
   ```
4. Initiate exchange of bond asset `bond01:a04` of `Bob` in `network1` with token assets `token1:100` of `Alice` in `network2`, by running (it only works with SHA256)
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange-all --network1=network1 --network2=network2 --secret=secrettext --timeout-duration=100 bob:bond01:a04:alice:token1:100
   ```
   Repeat the step 3 to observe the change in the ownership of assets as a result of the `asset exchange` exercise.
   
5. Generate Secret-Hash Pair using following command (prints hash in base64):
    ```
    ./bin/fabric-cli hash --hash_fn=SHA256 secrettext
    ```
6. The same asset exchange experiment in the above step, can be carried out by manually triggering below commands in serial order (with the help of `fabric-cli asset exchange <operation>` CLI commands) (change hash function by specifying `--hash_fn=<SHA256|SHA512>` in lock and claim commands):
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange lock --timeout-duration=3600 --locker=alice --recipient=bob --hashBase64=<hash-value-base64> --target-network=network1 --param=bond01:a03
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange is-locked --locker=alice --recipient=bob --target-network=network1 --param=bond01:a03
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange lock --fungible --timeout-duration=1800 --locker=bob --recipient=alice --hashBase64=<hash-value-base64> --target-network=network2 --param=token1:100
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange is-locked --fungible --locker=bob --recipient=alice --target-network=network2 --contract-id=<contract-id>
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange claim --fungible --recipient=alice --target-network=network2 --contract-id=<contract-id> --secret=<hash-pre-image>
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange claim --recipient=bob --locker=alice --target-network=network1 --param=bond01:a03 --secret=<hash-pre-image>
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange unlock --locker=alice --recipient=bob --target-network=network1 --param=bond01:a03
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset exchange unlock --fungible --locker=bob --target-network=network2 --contract-id=<contract-id>
   ```
 
 The `asset exchange` scenario is demonstrated above using an application chaincode `simpleasset` and the `interop` chaincode, where the application chaincode makes invocations into the `interop` chaincode when it needs to lock, claim, or reclaim/unlock assets. However, the same `asset exchange` scenario can be demonstrated with the help of just the application chaincode `simpleassetandinterop` which also includes the scripts to lock, claim, or reclaim/unlock assets. This requires the steps 1-5 to be exercised with minor modifications as indicated below:
- Spin up the networks by running the below command (equivalent of step 1 above)
   ```bash
   make start CHAINCODE_NAME=simpleassetandinterop
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   make start-interop-local CHAINCODE_NAME=simpleassetandinterop
   ```
   depending on whether you are using pre-built Github packages or using local builds from this clone of the repository.
- Replace `simpleasset` with `simpleassetandinterop` in the `config.json` file used to populate the `.env` file that is part of the script `initAsset.sh` (equivalent of step 2 above)
- Replace `simpleasset` with `simpleassetandinterop` in the script `getAssetStatus.sh` (equivalent of step 3 above)

You can repeat the above experiment with the `simpleassettransfer` chaincode as well, though this chaincode contains augmentations that serve to demonstrate asset transfers (see below).


## Asset Transfer

Below are the steps to exercise asset transfers from `network1` to `network2` using the `fabric-cli` tool.
1. Spin up both `network1` and `network2` with interoperation chaincode installed along with the `simpleassettransfer` application by navigating to the `tests/network-setups/fabric/dev` folder and running either
   ```bash
   make start-interop CHAINCODE_NAME=simpleassettransfer
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   make start-interop-local CHAINCODE_NAME=simpleassettransfer
   ```
   depending on whether you are using pre-built Github packages or using local builds from this clone of the repository.
2. Start relays and Fabric drivers for both `network1` and `network2`.
3. Go to the Fabric Client `fabric-cli` directory (`samples/fabric/fabric-cli`).
4. Create a `config.json` (you can pick a different name, but make sure you set the right reference in the `CONFIG_PATH` property in `.env`) by copying `config.template.json` and set certain properties as shown below (you can leave the others unchanged):
   ```json
   {
      "network1": {
         ...
         "chaincode": "simpleassettransfer",
         ...
      },
      "network2": {
         ...
         "chaincode": "simpleassettransfer",
         "aclPolicyPrincipalType": "ca"
      }
   }
   ```
4. Set the `DEFAULT_APPLICATION_CHAINCODE` property in the `.env` to `simpleassettransfer`.
5. Set environment variables and network configuration properties as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli env set-file ./.env
   ./bin/fabric-cli config set-file ./config.json
   ```
6. Create default access control and verification policies and record them in the two networks' ledgers as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli configure create all --local-network=network1
   ./bin/fabric-cli configure create all --local-network=network2
   ./bin/fabric-cli configure network --local-network=network1
   ./bin/fabric-cli configure network --local-network=network2
   ```
7. Initialize bond and token asset states and ownerships on the `network1` ledger as follows:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/initAssetsForTransfer.sh
   ```
   This step will also create a user `alice` in `network1` and a user `bob` in `network2`.

**The following sequence of operations will illustrate transfers and recoveries of a bond (non-fungible) asset.**

8. Verify that `alice` owns bonds with ids `a03` and `a04` as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli chaincode query --user=alice mychannel simpleassettransfer ReadAsset '["bond01","a03"]' --local-network=network1
   ./bin/fabric-cli chaincode query --user=alice mychannel simpleassettransfer ReadAsset '["bond01","a04"]' --local-network=network1
   ```
   You should see a JSON structure corresponding to the bond being logged on the console in each case.
9. Get `alice` in `network1` to pledge bond `a03` to `bob` in `network2` as follows (with a 1 hour timeout):
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer pledge --source-network=network1 --dest-network=network2 --recipient=bob --expiry-secs=3600 --type=bond --ref=a03 --data-file=src/data/assetsForTransfer.json
   ```
   You should see a message containing the unique ID of this pledge on the console as `Asset pledged with ID <pledge-id>` (`<pledge-id>` is a hexadecimal string).
10. Get `bob` in `network2` to claim this bond asset as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer claim --source-network=network1 --dest-network=network2 --user=bob --owner=alice --type=bond --pledge-id=<pledge-id> --param=bond01:a03
   ```
11. Verify that `alice` in `network1` does not own this asset as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli chaincode query --user=alice mychannel simpleassettransfer ReadAsset '["bond01","a03"]' --local-network=network1
   ```
   You should see an error message like `Error: the asset a03 does not exist`.
12. Verify that `bob` in `network2` now owns this asset as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli chaincode query --user=bob mychannel simpleassettransfer ReadAsset '["bond01","a03"]' --local-network=network2
   ```
13. Now get `alice` in `network1` to pledge bond `a04` to `bob` in `network2` as follows (with a 1 minute timeout):
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer pledge --source-network=network1 --dest-network=network2 --recipient=bob --expiry-secs=60 --type=bond --ref=a04 --data-file=src/data/assetsForTransfer.json
   ```
   Wait for a minute as follows:
   ```bash
   sleep 60
   ```
   You should see a message containing the unique ID of this pledge on the console as `Asset pledged with ID <pledge-id>` (`<pledge-id>` is a hexadecimal string).
14. Now get `bob` in `network2` to claim this bond asset as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer claim --source-network=network1 --dest-network=network2 --user=bob --owner=alice --type=bond --pledge-id=<pledge-id> --param=bond01:a04
   ```
   This should fail as the pledge has already expired.
15. Now get `alice` in `network1` to reclaim the asset as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer reclaim --source-network=network1 --user=alice --type=bond --pledge-id=<pledge-id> --param=bond01:a04
   ```
16. Verify that `alice` in `network1` owns this asset as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli chaincode query --user=alice mychannel simpleassettransfer ReadAsset '["bond01","a04"]' --local-network=network1
   ```
17. Verify that `bob` in `network2` does not own this asset as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli chaincode query --user=bob mychannel simpleassettransfer ReadAsset '["bond01","a04"]' --local-network=network2
   ```
   You should see an error message like `Error: the asset a04 does not exist`.

**The following sequence of operations will illustrate transfers and recoveries of token (fungible) assets.**

18. Verify that `alice` in `network1` owns `10000` tokens as follows:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/getTokenBalance.sh network1 alice
   ```
19. Verify that `bob` in `network2` owns no tokens as follows:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/getTokenBalance.sh network2 bob
   ```
   You should see an error message like `Error: owner does not have a wallet`.
20. Get `alice` in `network1` to pledge 50 tokens to `bob` in `network2` as follows (with a 1 hour timeout):
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer pledge --source-network=network1 --dest-network=network2 --recipient=bob --expiry-secs=3600 --type=token --units=50 --owner=alice --data-file=src/data/tokensForTransfer.json
   ```
   You should see a message containing the unique ID of this pledge on the console as `Asset pledged with ID <pledge-id>` (`<pledge-id>` is a hexadecimal string).
21. Get `bob` in `network2` to claim these tokens as follows (replace `<pledge-id>` with the above hexadecimal value):
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer claim --source-network=network1 --dest-network=network2 --user=bob --owner=alice --type=token --pledge-id=<pledge-id> --param=token1:50
   ```
22. Verify that `alice` in `network1` owns `9950` tokens (after losing `50`) as follows:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/getTokenBalance.sh network1 alice
   ```
23. Verify that `bob` in `network2` now owns `50` tokens as follows:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/getTokenBalance.sh network2 bob
   ```
24. Now get `alice` in `network1` to pledge 100 tokens to `bob` in `network2` as follows (with a 1 minute timeout):
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer pledge --source-network=network1 --dest-network=network2 --recipient=bob --expiry-secs=60 --type=token --units=100 --owner=alice --data-file=src/data/tokensForTransfer.json
   ```
   Wait for a minute as follows:
   ```bash
   sleep 60
   ```
   You should see a message containing the unique ID of this pledge on the console as `Asset pledged with ID <pledge-id>` (`<pledge-id>` is a hexadecimal string).
25. Now get `bob` in `network2` to claim these tokens as follows (replace `<pledge-id>` with the above hexadecimal value):
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer claim --source-network=network1 --dest-network=network2 --user=bob --owner=alice --type=token --pledge-id=<pledge-id> --param=token1:100
   ```
   This should fail as the pledge has already expired.
26. Now get `alice` in `network1` to reclaim these tokens as follows:
   ```bash
   ./bin/fabric-cli asset transfer reclaim --source-network=network1 --user=alice --type=token --pledge-id=<pledge-id> --param=token1:100
   ```
27. Verify that `alice` in `network1` still owns `9950` tokens (after losing `50`) as follows:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/getTokenBalance.sh network1 alice
   ```
28. Verify that `bob` in `network2` still owns only `50` tokens as follows:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/getTokenBalance.sh network2 bob
   ```

## Events

* To subscribe for one or more events, generate a JSON file like: [Sample Event Sub JSON](./src/data/event_sub_sample.json), which contains an array of event subscription specifications. The samples provided here assume that the driver of `network1` is subscribing to an event of `network2`. Then run the following command (and note the request id which will be used to unsubscribe or get status):
    ```
    ./bin/fabric-cli event subscribe --network=network1 src/data/event_sub_sample.json
    ```
* To unsuscribe for one or more events, use the same JSON file as in subscription like: [Sample Event Sub JSON](./src/data/event_sub_sample.json). Then run the following command:
    ```
    ./bin/fabric-cli event unsubscribe --network=network1 --request-ids=<colon-separated-list-of-request-ids> src/data/event_sub_sample.json
    ```
* To get the status of an event subscription, run the following command:
    ```
    ./bin/fabric-cli event get-subscription-status --network=network1 --request-id=<request-id>
    ```
* To start the HTTP server to listen to the published events by the destination/importing relay (fetched from the source/exporting network), run the following command:
    ```
    ./bin/fabric-cli event receive
    ```
  By default, it will start the below endpoint:
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/simple-event-callback
    ```
* To fetch the statuses of all the events received, run the following command:
    ```
    ./bin/fabric-cli event get-all --network=network1 --request-id=<request-id>
    ```

## NOTE

Due to how Fabric works and the CA works once a wallet has been created with identities in the CA you cannot create new wallet without fist revoking the original credentials. This can have some issues if you have deleted a wallet and are trying to recreate one.
