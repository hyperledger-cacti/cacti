    #
    # Script debugging: by default the debugging feature is turned
    # off. You may want to uncomment this variable definition to

    # Default Relay Server Configuration
    # -----------------------------------------------------------
    # These settings support the default setup of the relay which
    # uses the default configuration template:
    #
    # ./docker/server.template.toml
    #
    # This template externalises most of the common information
    # that is of use in a standard configurartion with references
    # to environment variable in the form ${VAR_NAME}. This allows
    # for quickly deploying a relay server with the minimum amount
    # of information required.
    #
    # NOTE: the template is only used if an actual configuration
    #       specified through the RELAY_CONFIG file is not provided.
    #       By default this variable points to the configuration:
    #
    #       /opt/relay/config/server.toml
    #
    #       The standard image does not have this file and users
    #       of the relay image may decide to supply their own
    #       configuration, which will then override the default
    #       behaviour of using the template.
    #
    # Server configuration: this section provides the details for
    # specialising the server configuration. These variables are
    # only in effect if we do use the standard template for the
    # server configuration, since the corresponding values will
    # be injected in the configuration template to specialise it
    # and generate the actual configuration.

    # Driver configuration: this section provides the details of the
    # driver the relay is connected to. We need to supply the port,
    # hostname, and name of the driver. The current configuration
    # shows the details for a Dummy Driver setup and is only relevant
