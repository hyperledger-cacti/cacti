/**
 * The QuerySerializer class defines how the Query class generated from the proto files
 * should be serialized and deserialized in order to be passed across the wire.
 *
 * This is necessary because the instances of the generated classes from the proto files
 * need to be created using a Builder instead of a public constructor. Therefore, it is
 * not possible to merely include these classes on the [CustomSerializationWhitelist] as
 * is possible with other classes.
 *
 * The QuerySerializer has a Proxy class with a public constructor that can be serialized,
 * and two methods, toProxy and fromProxy that describe how the Query class should be
 * converted to a Proxy class to be passed across the wire, and then from a Proxy class
 * back to a Query class on the receiving end.
