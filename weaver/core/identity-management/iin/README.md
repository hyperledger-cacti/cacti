# Interoperation Identity Network Reference Implementation

In this folder lies a reference implementation of an IIN according to the [RFC specification](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/blob/main/rfcs/models/identity/iin.md). This sample IIN is built on Hyperledger Indy, which offers a feature set closest to what is required by a Weaver IIN. (_Note_: Weaver does not mandate the use of Indy, and may provide reference implementations of IINs on other platforms in the future.)

_This is currently a placeholder._
