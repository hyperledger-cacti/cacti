# Directory Content

This directory is meant to contain all the artifacts that are to be deployed in the Corda Network (i.e. Interoperability CorDapp and Test CordApp). The folder does not have checked in anything it is only a placeholder for artifacts, the developers are required to copy the artifacts here. 

This is to ensure that we have the most flexibility in our development and test experience:

- they can be pulled from the artifact repository (via another script)
- they can copied from a local file system 

The first option is more likely to be used by team members that do not work on the Interoperability CorDapp, while the second option by team members that want to use development version of the CorDapp during build-test cycles.
