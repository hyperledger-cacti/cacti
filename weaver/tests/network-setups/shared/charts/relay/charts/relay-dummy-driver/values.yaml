# NOTE: this setting WILL ONLY take effect if there is no server configuration 
#       supplied to the container. In that case corresponding values stored

#       
#       In the specific case where a concrete configuration is supplied the
#       the values for the host and the port MUST match the values entered 
#       here, because these values are used to create the service instance
#       that exposes the relay deployment.

# This section provides information about the network that is being

# and should match the name of the network put in the relay configuration
# file if it is supplied.

# NOTE: this setting WILL ONLY take effect if a server configuration

# Uncomment this entry if you want to enable the debug mode of the

discovery:
  # This section specifies the details of the associated relay server that
  # the driver is going to connect to. We need the information about the name, 
  # host, and port of the server. These details are exposed through environment
  # variables and then injected in the relay configuration, via specialisation
  # of the server configuration template.

  # NOTE: these settings WILL NOT TAKE EFFECT if a specific configuration file
  #       is being supplied.

# This section provides information about the configuration settings

# configure here the location of server configuration file and the

configuration:
  # This is the path to the file that represents the driver configuration.

  # This is the path to the driver configuration file template. The default
  # value for the environment variable is shown. This file is used to generate
  # the configuration at runtime based on the environment variables supplied
  # to the relay driver and it is only used if a specific configuration file
  # is not used.
