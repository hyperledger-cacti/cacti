# Integration Test Setup

This folder contains the network definitions and the script logic that is used to setup and configure
the networks in the integration test environment. There is one folder for each different type of network.

- `fabric` contains the configuration settings for fabric networks
- `corda` contains the configuration settings for corda networks

The networks are operated and managed via Kubernetes/Openshift.
