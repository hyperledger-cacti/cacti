        # (in case of a just-restarted orderer), the orderer interacts with the

        # 1. It creates a Kafka producer (writer) for the Kafka partition that
        # corresponds to the channel.
        # 2. It uses that producer to post a no-op CONNECT message to that
        # partition
        # 3. It creates a Kafka consumer (reader) for that partition.
        # If any of these steps fail, they will be re-attempted every
        # <ShortInterval> for a total of <ShortTotal>, and then every
        # <LongInterval> for a total of <LongTotal> until they succeed.
