## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

> If the RFC you are proposing is **NOT** a protocol, please use [this template](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/0000-template.md) as a starting point.

> When completing this template and before submitting as a PR, please remove the template text in sections (other than **Implementations**). The implementations section should remain as is.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?


## Name and Version

Name and Version

Specify the official name of the protocol and its version, e.g., "My Protocol 0.9".

Protocol names are conventionally lower_snake_case (especially in URIs), but are compared case-insensitively and ignoring punctuation. This means that all of the following protocol names are considered identical in comparison, and can be used interchangeably, depending on what's appropriate for a given context (a user-friendly doc vs. CSS vs. python class vs. java class):

- Let's Do Lunch!
- lets-do-lunch
- lets_do_lunch
- LetsDoLunch

URI: https://didcomm.org/lets_do_lunch/<version>/<messageType>

Message types and protocols are identified with special URIs that match certain conventions. See [Message Type and Protocol Identifier URIs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0003-protocols/#message-type-and-protocol-identifier-uris) for more details.

The version of a protocol is declared carefully. See [Semver Rules for Protocols](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0003-protocols/#semver-rules-for-protocols) for details.

## Key Concepts

This is short--a paragraph or two. It defines terms and describes the flow of
the interaction at a very high level. Key preconditions should be noted (e.g.,
"You can't issue a credential until you have completed the _connection_ protocol
first"), as well as ways the protocol can start and end, and what can go wrong.
The section might also talk about timing constraints and other assumptions.
After reading this section, a developer should know what problem your protocol
solves, and should have a rough idea of how the protocol works in its simpler
variants.

## Roles

> See [this note](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0003-protocols/#roles-participants-parties-and-controllers) for definitions of the terms
"role", "participant", and "party".

Provides a formal name to each role in the protocol, says who and how many can
play each role, and describes constraints associated with those roles (e.g.,
"You can only issue a credential if you have a DID on the public ledger"). The
issue of qualification for roles can also be explored (e.g., "The holder of the
credential must be known to the issuer").

The formal names for each role are important because they are used when [agents
discover one another's
capabilities](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0031-discover-features);
an agent doesn't just claim that it supports a protocol; it makes a claim about
which *roles* in the protocol it supports. An agent that supports credential
issuance and an agent that supports credential holding may have very different
features, but they both use the _credential-issuance_ protocol. By convention,
role names use lower-kebab-case but are compared case-insensitively and ignoring
punctuation.

## States

This section lists the possible states that exist for each role. It also
enumerates the events (often but not always messages) that can occur, including
errors, and what should happen to state as a result. A formal representation of
this information is provided in a _state machine matrix_. It lists events as
columns, and states as rows; a cell answers the question, "If I am in state X
(=row), and event Y (=column) occurs, what happens to my state?" The [Tic Tac
Toe example](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0003-protocols/tictactoe/README.md#states) is typical.

[Choreography Diagrams](
https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/bpmn/bpmn-orchestration-vs-choreography-vs-collaboration/#bpmn-choreography)
from [BPMN](http://www.bpmn.org/) are good artifacts here, as are [PUML sequence diagrams](
http://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) and [UML-style state machine diagrams](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/stateMachineDiagram.htm).
The matrix form is nice because it forces an exhaustive analysis of every
possible event. The diagram styles are often simpler to create and consume,
and the PUML and BPMN forms have the virtue that they can support line-by-line
diffs when checked in with source code. However, they don't offer an
easy way to see if all possible flows have been considered; what they may
NOT describe isn't obvious. This--and the freedom from fancy tools--is why
the matrix form is used in many early RFCs. We leave it up to
the community to settle on whether it wants to strongly recommend specific
diagram types.

The formal names for each state are important, as they are used in [`ack`s](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0015-acks)
and [`problem-report`s](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0035-report-problem)).
For example, a `problem-report` message declares which state the sender
arrived at because of the problem. This helps other participants
to react to errors with confidence. Formal state names are also used in the
agent test suite, in log messages, and so forth.

By convention, state names use lower-kebab-case but are compared
case-insensitively and ignoring punctuation.

State management in protocols is a deep topic. For more information, please
see [State Details and State Machines](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0003-protocols#state-details-and-state-machines).

## Messages

If there is a message family associated with this protocol, this
section describes each member of it. It should also note the names and
versions of messages from other message families that are used by the
protocol (e.g., an [`ack`](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0015-acks)
or a [`problem-report`](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0035-report-problem)).
Typically this section is written as a narrative, showing each message
type in the context of an end-to-end sample interaction. All possible
fields may not appear; an exhaustive catalog is saved for the "Reference"
section.

Sample messages that are presented in the narrative should also be checked
in next to the markdown of the RFC, in [DIDComm Plaintext format](
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0044-didcomm-file-and-mime-types#didcomm-messages-dm).

### Adopted Messages

Many protocols should use general-purpose messages such as [`ack`](
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/77) and [`problem-report`](
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/65)) at certain points in
an interaction. This reuse is strongly encouraged because it helps us avoid
defining redundant message types--and the code to handle them--over and
over again (see [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)).

However, using messages with generic values of `@type` (e.g., `"@type":
"https://didcomm.org/notification/1.0/ack"`)
introduces a challenge for agents as they route messages to their internal
routines for handling. We expect internal handlers to be organized around
protocols, since a protocol is a discrete unit of business value as well
as a unit of testing in our agent test suite. Early work on agents has
gravitated towards pluggable, routable protocols as a unit of code
encapsulation and dependency as well. Thus the natural routing question
inside an agent, when it sees a message, is "Which protocol handler should
I route this message to, based on its @type?" A generic `ack` can't be
routed this way.

Therefore, we allow a protocol to __adopt__ messages into its namespace.
This works very much like python's `from module import symbol` syntax.
It changes the `@type` attribute of the adopted message. Suppose a `rendezvous`
protocol is identified by the URI `https://didcomm.org/rendezvous/2.0`,
and its definition announces that it has adopted generic 1.x `ack`
messages. When such `ack` messages are sent, the `@type` should now use
the alias defined inside the namespace of the `rendezvous` protocol:

![diff on @type caused by adoption](concepts/0003-protocols/adoption.png)

Adoption should be declared in an "Adopted" subsection of "Messages" in
a protocol RFC. When adoption is specified, it should include a __minimum
adopted version__ of the adopted message type: "This protocol adopts
`ack` with version >= 1.4". All versions of the adopted message that share
the same major number should be compatible, given the [semver rules](concepts/0003-protocols/semver.md)
that apply to protocols.


## Examples

This section is optional. It can be used to show alternate flows through
the protocol.
