# Interoperability RFCs

These RFCs capture abstractions, models, protocols and data formats for facilitating cross-ledger communication and transactions.

If you are new to Weaver (or to blockchain interoperability), we recommend starting with the [protocol overview document](../OVERVIEW.md).

If you wish to see Weaver in action, test it, or apply it to your own application, you can switch to the [Getting Started Tutorial](https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/docs/external/getting-started/guide).

Instead, if you wish to find out more details about the Weaver design and wish to contribute to the code base, you can explore these RFCs, beginning with the [models](./models). Protocol engineers will find in [RFC: 01-009](./models/infrastructure/relays.md) a useful overview of the relay model, and may then progress on to reading one of the existing protocols' design and implementation; e.g., the data sharing protocol in [RFC: 02-001](./protocols/data-sharing/generic.md). If you are interested in adding support for a new ledger technology, see the [existing driver implementations](../core/drivers) and [existing interoperability module implementations](../core/network). Where relevant we use [ABNF](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234) for formal syntax definitions.

Precise definitions of terms you may encounter in these RFCs can be found in the [terminology page](terminology.md).
