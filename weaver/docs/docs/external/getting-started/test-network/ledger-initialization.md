Once the two Fabric networks and the Corda network are up and running along with their associated relays and drivers, we must initialize states in those networks to prepare them for interoperation. For the Fabric networks, this involves recording state in the channel ledgers, and for the Corda network, in the nodes' vaults. The configuration and bootstrapping takes different form depending on what [interoperability mode](../../interoperability-modes.md) you wish to test.

## Preparation for Data Sharing

Follow the below instructions to prepare your networks for data sharing tests.

### Initializing the Fabric Networks

We use the Fabric CLI (`fabric-cli`) built earlier (in `weaver/samples/fabric/fabric-cli` for the Node.js version and `weaver/samples/fabric/go-cli` for the Golang version) for this purpose.

#### Configuring the Fabric CLI

During bootstrap, the ledgers in both `network1` and `network2` must be populated with the following information scoped by the interoperation chaincode:
- Access control policies governing requests from foreign networks
- Security group info for foreign networks (i.e., identities of network units and their membership providers' certificate chains)
- Verification policies for proofs supplied by foreign networks
Knowledge of foreign networks that must be configured in this stage is as follows:
- `network1` has policies and security group info for `network2` and `Corda_Network`
- `network2` has policies and security group info for `network1` and `Corda_Network`
(_`Corda_Network` will be launched later._)
The ledgers must also be populated with sample key-value pairs for testing interoperation flows, scoped by the sample application chaincode.

Prepare `fabric-cli` for configuration suitably as follows.
- Navigate to the `weaver/samples/fabric/fabric-cli` (for the Node.js version) or the `weaver/samples/fabric/go-cli` (for the Golang version) folder.
- Create a `config.json` file by copying the `config.template.json` and setting (or adding or removing) suitable values:
  * For each network, the relay port and connection profile paths are specified using the keys `relayPort` and `connProfilePath` respectively.
    - Replace `<PATH-TO-WEAVER>` with the absolute path location of the `weaver` folder within your Cacti repository clone.
    - Otherwise, leave the default values unchanged.
- Create a `chaincode.json` file by copying the `chaincode.json.template` and leaving the default values unchanged. This file specified the arguments of the transaction to be locally invoked after fetching a remote view.
- Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.template` and setting the following parameter values:
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the host machine:
    ```
    MEMBER_CREDENTIAL_FOLDER=<PATH-TO-WEAVER>/samples/fabric/fabric-cli/src/data/credentials
    DEFAULT_APPLICATION_CHAINCODE=<chaincode-name>
    DEFAULT_APPLICATION_FUNC=<function-name>
    CONFIG_PATH=./config.json
    CHAINCODE_PATH=./chaincode.json
    ```
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the Docker containers:
    ```
    MEMBER_CREDENTIAL_FOLDER=<PATH-TO-WEAVER>/samples/fabric/fabric-cli/src/data/credentials_docker
    DEFAULT_APPLICATION_CHAINCODE=<chaincode-name>
    DEFAULT_APPLICATION_FUNC=<function-name>
    CONFIG_PATH=./config.json
    CHAINCODE_PATH=./chaincode.json
    ```
  * In each case, replace `<PATH-TO-WEAVER>` with the absolute path location of the `weaver` folder within your Cacti repository clone and `<chaincode-name>` with the name of the deployed chaincode, either `simplestate` or `simplestatewithacl`.
  * If `simplestate` is deployed, set `<function-name>` to `Create`, and if `simplestatewithacl` if deployed, set `<function-name>` to `CreateFromRemote`.
  * Leave the default values unchanged for the other parameters.
- Run the following command:
  ```bash
  ./bin/fabric-cli env set-file ./.env
  ```
| Notes |
|:------|
| If the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is omitted from `.env`, then you must also run:<br/>```./bin/fabric-cli config set-file ./config.json``` |

#### Bootstrapping Network and Application State

Finally, to prepare both `network1` and `network2` for interoperation, run:

```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure all network1 network2
```

If Fabric networks were launched with 2 organizations, run:
```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure all network1 network2 --num-orgs=2
```

Instead, if you launched only one of the two Fabric networks, run the following after replacing `<network-id>` with either `network1` or `network2`, and `<1/2>` with number of organizations in the network:
```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure all <network-id> --num-orgs=<1/2>
```

**Wait for at least 5 minutes before moving on to the next step (testing interoperability modes) to allow the networks' IIN Agents to sync their respective memberships (which occur after every 5 minutes by default).**

**Optionally**, fabric-cli can be used to trigger sync manually by running following command: 
```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure membership --local-network=network1 --target-network=network2 --iin-agent-endpoint=localhost:9500
```
This command syncs `network2`'s membership (target-network) in `network1` (local-network) using IIN Agent of `Org1MSP` as initiator. Similarly `network1`'s membership can be synced to `network2`'s ledger by running:
```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure membership --local-network=network2 --target-network=network1 --iin-agent-endpoint=localhost:9501
```
Wait for 20-30 seconds after above commands to allow IIN Agents to finish the sync.

### Initializing the Corda Networks

Once the Corda networks are launched, the client applications (built earlier) needs to be exercised to generate network (ledger) state in preparation to test interoperation flows.

#### Bootstrapping Networks and Application States
Just as we did for either Fabric network, the Corda network ledger (or _vault_ on each node) must be initialized with access control policies, verification policies, and security group information for the two Fabric networks. Further, sample key-value pairs need to be recorded so we can later share them with a Fabric network via an interoperation flow.

Bootstrap the Corda networks and application states as follows (_the following instructions will initialize either or both Corda networks, depending on which of those are up and running_):
- Navigate to the `weaver/samples/corda/corda-simple-application` folder.
- Run the following: 
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the host machine:
    ```bash
    make initialise-vault
    ```
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    make initialise-vault-docker
    ```
(Add a note about ignoring errors if only one of the two networks was launched, as the init command tries to initialize both networks.)

### Next Steps

The test networks are now configured and their ledgers are initialized. You can now run the [data sharing flows](../interop/data-sharing.md).


## Preparation for Asset Exchange

Follow the below instructions to prepare your networks for asset exchange tests.

### Initializing the Fabric Networks

We use the Fabric CLI (`fabric-cli`) built earlier (in `weaver/samples/fabric/fabric-cli` for the Node.js version and `weaver/samples/fabric/go-cli` for the Golang version) for this purpose.

#### Configuring the Fabric CLI

The ledgers must be populated with sample key-value pairs for testing interoperation flows, scoped by the sample application chaincode.

Prepare `fabric-cli` for configuration suitably as follows.
- Navigate to the `weaver/samples/fabric/fabric-cli` (for the Node.js version) or the `weaver/samples/fabric/go-cli` (for the Golang version) folder.
- Create a `config.json` file by copying the `config.template.json` and setting (or adding or removing) suitable values:
  * For each network, the relay port and connection profile paths are specified using the keys `relayPort` and `connProfilePath` respectively.
    - Replace `<PATH-TO-WEAVER>` with the absolute path location of the `weaver` folder within your Cacti repository clone.
    - Set the `chaincode` attribute in each network to the deployed chaincode name (`simpleasset` or `simpleassetandinterop` or `simpleassettransfer`).
    - Otherwise, leave the default values unchanged.
- Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.template` and setting following parameter values:
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the host machine:
    ```
    MEMBER_CREDENTIAL_FOLDER=<PATH-TO-WEAVER>/samples/fabric/fabric-cli/src/data/credentials
    CONFIG_PATH=./config.json
    ```
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the Docker containers:
    ```
    MEMBER_CREDENTIAL_FOLDER=<PATH-TO-WEAVER>/samples/fabric/fabric-cli/src/data/credentials_docker
    CONFIG_PATH=./config.json
    ```
  * In each case, replace `<PATH-TO-WEAVER>` with the absolute path location of the `weaver` folder within your Cacti repository clone.
  * Leave the default values unchanged for the other parameters.
- Run the following command:
  ```bash
  ./bin/fabric-cli env set-file ./.env
  ```
| Notes |
|:------|
| If the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is omitted from `.env`, then you must also run:<br/>```./bin/fabric-cli config set-file ./config.json``` |

#### Bootstrapping Network and Application State

Finally, to prepare both `network1` and `network2` for interoperation, run:

```bash
./scripts/initAsset.sh
```

### Initializing the Corda Networks

Corda Network needs to be initialized with assets for asset-exchange to be performed:
Bootstrap the Corda network and application states as follows:
- Navigate to the `weaver/samples/corda/corda-simple-application` folder.
- Run the following: 
  - For `cordaSimpleApplication` app, run:
    ```
    ./scripts/initAsset.sh
    ```

### Initializing the Besu Networks

Let's assume that `network1` can either manage NFT `AliceERC721` or Hybrid `AliceERC1155` tokens, while `network2` manages fungible `BobERC20` tokens. Here we use account `1` for Alice and account `2` for Bob in both neworks. To prepare Besu networks for asset exchange, navigate to the `weaver/samples/besu/besu-cli` and then follow the steps in next subsections.

#### Configuring the Besu-CLI

Create a `config.json` file by copying the `config.template.json`, keep the default values for managing `AliceERC721` tokens in `network1` and `BobERC20` tokens in `network2`.
If you want to change the token type used in the `network1` to Hybrid `AliceERC1155` tokens, in `config.json` update `tokenContract` field with value `"../simpleasset/build/contracts/AliceERC1155.json".`
  
#### Bootstrapping Network and Application State

Finally, to prepare both `network1` and `network2` for interoperation, run:

* If you wish to test the default exchange (ERC-20 tokens for ERC-721 tokens), run::
  ```bash
  ./scripts/initAsset.sh
  ```
  This will issue `100 BobERC20` tokens to each account in `network2` and `AliceERC721` token with id `0` to `Alice` and id `1` to `Bob` in `network1`.
* Instead, if you wish to test Alice's exchange of ERC-1155 tokens for Bob's ERC-20 tokens, run:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/initAsset.sh hybrid
  ```
  This will issue `100 BobERC20` tokens to each account in `network2` and `100 AliceERC1155` tokens with id `0` to `Alice` and id `1` to `Bob` in `network1`.
  

### Next Steps

The test networks are now configured and their ledgers are initialized. You can now run the [asset exchange flows](../interop/asset-exchange/overview.md).

## Preparation for Asset Transfer

Follow the below instructions to prepare your networks for asset transfer tests.

### Initializing the Fabric Networks

We use the Fabric CLI (`fabric-cli`) built earlier (in `weaver/samples/fabric/fabric-cli` for the Node.js version and `weaver/samples/fabric/go-cli` for the Golang version) for this purpose.

#### Configuring the Fabric CLI

During bootstrap, the ledgers in both `network1` and `network2` must be populated with the following information scoped by the interoperation chaincode:
- Access control policies governing requests from foreign networks
- Security group info for foreign networks (i.e., identities of network units and their membership providers' certificate chains)
- Verification policies for proofs supplied by foreign networks
Knowledge of foreign networks that must be configured in this stage is as follows:
- `network1` has policies and security group info for `network2` and `Corda_Network`
- `network2` has policies and security group info for `network1` and `Corda_Network`
(_The Corda sample application doesn't support asset transfer yet, but there is no harm in including it above._)
The ledgers must also be populated with sample key-value pairs for testing interoperation flows, scoped by the sample application chaincode.

Prepare `fabric-cli` for configuration suitably as follows.
- Navigate to the `weaver/samples/fabric/fabric-cli` folder (_the Go CLI doesn't support asset transfer yet_).
- Create a `config.json` file by copying the `config.template.json` and setting (or adding or removing) suitable values:
  * For each network, the relay port and connection profile paths are specified using the keys `relayPort` and `connProfilePath` respectively.
    - Replace `<PATH-TO-WEAVER>` with the absolute path location of the `weaver` folder within your Cacti repository clone.
    - Set the `chaincode` attribute in each network to `simpleassettransfer`.
    - Set the `aclPolicyPrincipalType` attribute in `network2` to `ca`.
    - Otherwise, leave the default values unchanged.
- Create `remote-network-config.json` file by copying `remote-network-config.json.template`. Use default values if relays and drivers are deployed in the host machine; else if they are deployed in Docker, update as follows:
  * Update value for `relayEndpoint` for `network1` as `relay-network1:9080`.
  * Update value for `relayEndpoint` for `network2` as `relay-network2:9083`.
  * Update value for `relayEndpoint` for `Corda_Network` as `relay-corda:9081`.
  * Update value for `relayEndpoint` for `Corda_Network2` as `relay-corda2:9082`.
  * Update value for `partyEndPoint` for `Corda_Network` as `corda_partya_1:10003`.
  * Update value for `partyEndPoint` for `Corda_Network2` as `corda_network2_partya_1:10003`.
- Create `chaincode.json` file by copying `chaincode.json.template`. Keep the default values unchanged.
- Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.template` and setting the following parameter values:
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the host machine:
    ```
    MEMBER_CREDENTIAL_FOLDER=<PATH-TO-WEAVER>/samples/fabric/fabric-cli/src/data/credentials
    DEFAULT_APPLICATION_CHAINCODE=simpleassettransfer
    CONFIG_PATH=./config.json
    REMOTE_CONFIG_PATH=./remote-network-config.json
    CHAINCODE_PATH=./chaincode.json
    ```
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the Docker containers:
    ```
    MEMBER_CREDENTIAL_FOLDER=<PATH-TO-WEAVER>/samples/fabric/fabric-cli/src/data/credentials_docker
    DEFAULT_APPLICATION_CHAINCODE=simpleassettransfer
    CONFIG_PATH=./config.json
    REMOTE_CONFIG_PATH=./remote-network-config.json
    CHAINCODE_PATH=./chaincode.json
    ```
  * In each case, replace `<PATH-TO-WEAVER>` with the absolute path location of the `weaver` folder within your Cacti repository clone.
  * Leave the default values unchanged for the other parameters.
- Run the following command:
  ```
  ./bin/fabric-cli env set-file ./.env
  ```
| Notes |
|:------|
| If the `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is omitted from `.env`, then you must also run:<br/>```./bin/fabric-cli config set-file ./config.json``` |

#### Bootstrapping Network and Application State

Create appropriate access control and verification policies for `network1` and `network2` by running:

```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure create all --local-network=network1
./bin/fabric-cli configure create all --local-network=network2
```

Load access control and verification policies onto the ledgers of `network1` and `network2` by running (replace `<1/2>` with number of organizations in the network):

```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure network --local-network=network1 --num-orgs=<1/2>
./bin/fabric-cli configure network --local-network=network2 --num-orgs=<1/2>
```

**Wait for at least 5 minutes before moving on to the next step (testing interoperability modes) to allow the networks' IIN Agents to sync their respective memberships (which occur after every 5 minutes by default).**

**Optionally**, fabric-cli can be used to trigger sync manually by running following command: 
```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure membership --local-network=network1 --target-network=network2 --iin-agent-endpoint=localhost:9500
```
This command syncs `network2`'s membership (target-network) in `network1` (local-network) using IIN Agent of `Org1MSP` as initiator. Similarly `network1`'s membership can be synced to `network2`'s ledger by running:
```bash
./bin/fabric-cli configure membership --local-network=network2 --target-network=network1 --iin-agent-endpoint=localhost:9501
```
Wait for 20-30 seconds after above commands to allow IIN Agents to finish the sync.

Initialize bond and token asset states and ownerships on the `network1` ledger by running the following (this step will also create a user `alice` in `network1` and a user `bob` in `network2`):

```bash
./scripts/initAssetsForTransfer.sh
```

### Initializing the Corda Networks

Once the Corda networks (`Corda_Network` and `Corda_Network2`) are launched, the client applications (built earlier) needs to be exercised to generate ledger state in both exporting/source and importing/destination networks in preparation to test asset transfer interoperation flows.

#### Bootstrapping Networks and Application States
The Corda network ledger (or _vault_ on each node) must be initialized with access control policies, verification policies, and security group information for the other networks (two Fabric networks and other Corda network).

Bootstrap the Corda networks and application states as follows (_the following instructions will initialize either or both Corda networks, depending on which of those are up and running_):
- Navigate to the `weaver/samples/corda/corda-simple-application` folder.
- Run the following:
  ```bash
  cp clients/src/main/resources/config/remote-network-config.json.template clients/src/main/resources/config/remote-network-config.json
  ```
  Use default values in `remote-network-config.json` if relays and drivers are deployed in the host machine; else if they are deployed in Docker, update as follows:
  * Update value for `relayEndpoint` for `network1` as `relay-network1:9080`.
  * Update value for `relayEndpoint` for `network2` as `relay-network2:9083`.
  * Update value for `relayEndpoint` for `Corda_Network` as `relay-corda:9081`.
  * Update value for `relayEndpoint` for `Corda_Network2` as `relay-corda2:9082`.
  * Update value for `partyEndPoint` for `Corda_Network` as `corda_partya_1:10003`.
  * Update value for `partyEndPoint` for `Corda_Network2` as `corda_network2_partya_1:10003`.
- Run the following: 
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the host machine:
    ```bash
    make initialise-vault-asset-transfer
    ```
  * If Relays and Drivers are deployed in the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    make initialise-vault-asset-transfer-docker
    ```
### Next Steps

The test networks are now configured and their ledgers are initialized. You can now run the [asset transfer flows](../interop/asset-transfer.md).
