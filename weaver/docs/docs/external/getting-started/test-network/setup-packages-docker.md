 In this document, we detail the steps using which you can bring up networks using the default configuration settings and by fetching pre-built Weaver interoperation modules, SDK libraries, and relay docker image, drivers docker images from GitHub Package repositories. To customize these settings (e.g., hostnames, ports), refer to the [Advanced Configuration page](./advanced-configuration.md).

| Notes |
|:------|
| All components are run within Docker containers, except client applications. |

 Follow the instructions below to build and run components followed by interoperation flows. These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu Linux (bash shell) and Mac OS. In general, they should work on any system and shell as long as the various dependencies have been installed and configured.

## Prerequisites

### Software
Before starting, make sure you have the following software installed on your host machine:
- Curl: _install using package manager, like `apt` on Debian/Ubuntu Linux_
- Git: [sample instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Docker: [sample instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (Latest version)
- Docker-Compose: [sample instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Version 1.28.2 or higher, but lower than version V2)
- Golang: [sample instructions](https://golang.org/dl/) (Version 1.16 or higher)
- Java (JDK and JRE): [sample instructions](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) (Version 8)
- Node.js and NPM: [sample instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) (Version 11 to Version 16 Supported)
- Yarn: [sample instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

### Credentials
Make sure you have an SSH or GPG key registered in https://github.com to allow seamless cloning of repositories (at present, various setup scripts clone repositories using the `https://` prefix but this may change to `git@` in the future).

#### Package Access Token:
Create a personal access token with `read:packages` access in GitHub in order to use modules published in GitHub packages. Refer [Creating a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for help.

Run `docker login ghcr.io`,  and provide GitHub email id as username and personal access token created above as password. This will allow Docker to fetch images of `relay`, `fabric-driver` and `corda-driver` from `hyperledger/cacti`.

## Getting the Code and Documentation

Clone the [cacti](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti) repository. The code to get a basic test network up and running and test data-sharing interoperation flows lies in the subfolder `weaver/tests/network-setups`, which should be your starting point, though the setups will rely on other parts of the repository, as you will find out in the instructions given on this page.

## Securing Components

| Notes |
|:------|
| The relays and drivers corresponding to the different test networks you will encounter below can be run with or without TLS enabled. But the default files used in the demonstrations assume that either all relays and drivers are TLS-enabled or none are. Therefore, you should determine at the outset whether or not you wish to run the entire set of components in TLS-enabled mode, and select appropriate commands in the provided instructions. |

## Hyperledger Fabric Components

Using the sequence of instructions below, you can start two separate Fabric networks, each with a single channel and application contract (chaincode). You can also start an interoperation contract, a relay and a _driver_ acting on behalf of each network. You can build a Fabric CLI tool with which you can initialize both networks' ledgers with access control policies, foreign networks' security groups (i.e., membership providers' certificate chains), and some sample key-value pairs that can be shared during subsequent interoperation flows.

### Fabric Network

The code for this lies in the `weaver/tests/network-setups` folder.

This folder contains code to create and launch networks `network1` and `network2` of identical specifications:
- Network: 1 peer, 1 peer CA, 1 ordering service node, 1 ordering service CA
- Single channel named `mychannel`
- One of the following contracts deployed on `mychannel`, the choice depending on the [interoperability mode](../../interoperability-modes.md) you wish to test:
  * `simplestate` ([Data Sharing](../interop/data-sharing.md)): supports simple transactions (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`) involving storage and lookup of <key, value> pairs.
  * `simplestatewithacl` ([Data Sharing](../interop/data-sharing.md)): identical to `simplestate` but with extra security features to ensure that the Weaver infrastructure cannot be bypassed by a malicious client of the network.
  * `simpleasset` ([Asset Exchange](../interop/asset-exchange/overview.md)): supports creation, modification, transfer, and deletion, as well as locking, unlocking, and claiming, of simple bonds and tokens (examples of non-fungible and fungible assets respectively).
  * `simpleassetandinterop` ([Asset Exchange](../interop/asset-exchange/overview.md)): identical to `simpleasset` but where the locking, unlocking, and claiming logic is imported as a library in the chaincode rather than available in the common Fabric Interoperation Chaincode (a Weaver component).
  * `simpleassettransfer` ([Asset Exchange](../interop/asset-exchange/overview.md) or [Asset Transfer](../interop/asset-transfer.md)): augmentation of `simpleasset` with asset pledging, claiming, and reclaiming features for cross-network transfers.

| Notes |
|:------|
| For new users, we recommend testing the Data Sharing feature first with the `simplestate` contract. To test the other modes, you can simply [tear down](#tear-down-the-setup) the Fabric networks and restart them with the appropriate chaincodes installed. |

Follow the instructions below to build and launch the networks:
- Navigate to the `weaver/tests/network-setups/fabric/dev` folder.
- To spin up both network1 and network2 with the interoperation chaincode and the default `simplestate` chaincode installed, run:
  ```bash
  make start-interop
  ```
- _To launch the networks with a different application chaincode from the above list, run_:
  ```bash
  make start-interop CHAINCODE_NAME=<chaincode-name>
  ```
- _To launch the networks with 2 organizations, each with a peer (this will enable more variation and experimentation, which you can attempt after testing interoperation protocols across basic network configurations), run_:
  ```bash
  make start-interop-local PROFILE="2-nodes"
  ```

| Notes |
|:------|
| If you do not wish to test Fabric-Fabric interoperation, you can choose to launch only one of the two networks along with its interoperation chaincode. For `network1`, run `make start-interop-network1`, and for `network2`, run `make start-interop-network2` |
| If you wish to enable end-to-end confidentiality by default in the interoperation modules that are deployed during network launch, set the environment variable `E2E_CONFIDENTIALITY` to `true` in the command line as follows: `E2E_CONFIDENTIALITY=true make start-interop` |

For more information, refer to the associated [README](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/tree/main/weaver/tests/network-setups/fabric/dev).

**Troubleshooting Tips**:
- If you see any errors during the launches, re-check the prerequisites (software installations and credentials). Ensure your network connection is working. As a safe bet, you can retry after cleanup: kill and remove all Docker containers and associated volumes.

### Fabric Relay

The relay is a module acting on behalf of a network, enabling interoperation flows with other networks by communicating with their relays.
The code for this lies in the `weaver/core/relay` folder.

Navigate to the `weaver/core/relay` folder and run a relay as follows:

* The `docker-compose.yaml` in this folder is minimally configured with default values. To modify it for use with the Fabric testnets, run:
  ```bash
  make convert-compose-method2
  ```
* (The `.env.n1` and `.env.n1.tls` files in the `docker/testnet-envs` directory contain environment variables used by the `network1` relay at startup and runtime.)
* (The `.env.n2` and `.env.n2.tls` files in the `docker/testnet-envs` directory contain environment variables used by the `network2` relay at startup and runtime.)
* To deploy the relay server for `network1` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make start-server COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker/testnet-envs/.env.n1'
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the relay server with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make start-server COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker/testnet-envs/.env.n1.tls'
  ```
* To deploy the relay server for `network2` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make start-server COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker/testnet-envs/.env.n2'
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the relay server with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make start-server COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker/testnet-envs/.env.n2.tls'
  ```
* After launching the relay(s), you can revert the `docker-compose.yaml` changes by running:
  ```bash
  make convert-compose-method1
  ```

For more information, see the [relay-docker README](https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti/tree/main/weaver/core/relay/relay-docker.md).

### Fabric Driver

A driver is a DLT-specific plugin invoked by the relay while channelling external data queries to the local peer network and collecting a response with proofs. The Fabric driver is built as a Fabric client application on the `fabric-network` NPM package.
The code for this lies in the `weaver/core/drivers/fabric-driver` folder.

Use the following steps to run Fabric drivers in Docker containers:
- Navigate to the `weaver/core/drivers/fabric-driver` folder.
* The `.env.n1` and `.env.n1.tls` files in the `docker-testnet-envs` directory contain environment variables used by the `network1` driver at startup and runtime. Edit either of these files (depending on whether you wish to start the relay with or without TLS) as follows:
  - Replace `<PATH-TO-WEAVER>` with the absolute path of the `weaver` folder within your Cacti repository clone.
* Repeat the above step for `.env.n2` or `.env.n2.tls` in `docker-testnet-envs` directory, which contain environment variables for the `network2` driver.
* To deploy the Fabric driver for `network1` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet-envs/.env.n1' NETWORK_NAME=$(grep NETWORK_NAME docker-testnet-envs/.env.n1 | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the driver with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet-envs/.env.n1.tls' NETWORK_NAME=$(grep NETWORK_NAME docker-testnet-envs/.env.n1.tls | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
* To deploy the Fabric driver for `network2` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet-envs/.env.n2' NETWORK_NAME=$(grep NETWORK_NAME docker-testnet-envs/.env.n2 | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the driver with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet-envs/.env.n2.tls' NETWORK_NAME=$(grep NETWORK_NAME docker-testnet-envs/.env.n2.tls | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```

### Fabric IIN Agent

IIN Agent is a client of a member of a DLT network or security domain with special permissions to update security domain identities and configurations on the ledger via the network's interoperation module. The code for this lies in the `weaver/core/identity-management/iin-agent` folder. Navigate to the `weaver/core/identity-management/iin-agent` folder.

#### Deployment

Use the following steps to run Fabric IIN Agents in Docker containers:
* The `.env.n1.org1` and `.env.n1.org1.tls` files in the `docker-testnet/envs` directory contain environment variables used by the iin-agent of `org1` of `network1` at startup and runtime. Edit either of these files (depending on whether you wish to start the relay with or without TLS) as follows:
  - Replace `<PATH-TO-WEAVER>` with the absolute path of the `weaver` folder within your Cacti repository clone.
  - If Fabric network was started with 1 org, and IIN Agents are to be started with TLS enabled, update the `DNS_CONFIG_PATH` variable as:
    ```
    DNS_CONFIG_PATH=./docker-testnet/configs/dnsconfig-tls.json
    ```
  - If Fabric network was started with 2 orgs, and IIN Agents are to be started without TLS, update the `DNS_CONFIG_PATH` variable as
    ```
    DNS_CONFIG_PATH=./docker-testnet/configs/dnsconfig-2-nodes.json
    ```
  - If Fabric network was started with 2 orgs and IIN Agents are to be started with TLS enabled, update the `DNS_CONFIG_PATH` variable as:
    ```
    DNS_CONFIG_PATH=./docker-testnet/configs/dnsconfig-tls-2-nodes.json
    ```
* Repeat the above steps for all other environment variable files (depending upon whether tls is enabled) in `docker-testnet/envs` directory.
* To deploy the Fabric IIN Agent for `org1` of `network1` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet/envs/.env.n1.org1' DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR=$(grep DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR docker-testnet/envs/.env.n1.org1 | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the IIN Agent with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet/envs/.env.n1.org1.tls' DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR=$(grep DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR docker-testnet/envs/.env.n1.org1.tls | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
* To deploy the Fabric IIN Agent for `org2` of `network1` without TLS (_only required if Fabric network was started with 2 orgs_), run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet/envs/.env.n1.org2' DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR=$(grep DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR docker-testnet/envs/.env.n1.org2 | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the IIN Agent with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet/envs/.env.n1.org2.tls' DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR=$(grep DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR docker-testnet/envs/.env.n1.org2.tls | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
* To deploy the Fabric IIN Agent for `org1` of `network2` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet/envs/.env.n2.org1' DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR=$(grep DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR docker-testnet/envs/.env.n2.org1 | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the IIN Agent with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet/envs/.env.n2.org1.tls' DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR=$(grep DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR docker-testnet/envs/.env.n2.org1.tls | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
* To deploy the Fabric IIN Agent for `org2` of `network2` without TLS (_only required if Fabric network was started with 2 orgs_), run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet/envs/.env.n2.org2' DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR=$(grep DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR docker-testnet/envs/.env.n2.org2 | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the IIN Agent with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet/envs/.env.n2.org2.tls' DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR=$(grep DLT_SPECIFIC_DIR docker-testnet/envs/.env.n2.org2.tls | cut -d '=' -f 2)
  ```


### Fabric Client (Application)

The CLI is used to interact with a Fabric network, configure it and run chaincode transactions to record data on the channel ledger or query data. It is also used to interact with remote networks through the relay in order to trigger an interoperation flow for data request and acceptance.

The `fabric-cli` Node.js source code is located in the `weaver/samples/fabric/fabric-cli` folder and the Golang source code in the `weaver/samples/fabric/go-cli` folder.

#### Prerequisites

If you are using a Linux system, make sure that lib64 is installed.

| Notes |
|:------|
| For the Node.js version of the `fabric-cli`, the setup and running instructions below were tested with all Node.js versions from v11.14.0 to v14.17.3. |

#### Installation

You can install `fabric-cli` as follows (for both the Node.js and Golang versions):
- Navigate to the `weaver/samples/fabric/fabric-cli` folder (for the Node.js version) or the `weaver/samples/fabric/go-cli` folder.
- Create `.npmrc` from template `.npmrc.template`, by replacing `<personal-access-token>` with yours created [above](#package-access-token)..
- Run the following to install dependencies (for the Node.js version) or the executable (for the Golang version):
  ```bash
  make build
  ```
- Use the `fabric-cli` executable in the `bin` folder for [subsequent actions](./ledger-initialization.md).

## Corda Components

Using the sequence of instructions below, you can start a Corda network and run an application CorDapp on it. You can also run an interoperation CorDapp, a relay and a _driver_ acting on behalf of the network. You can initialize the network's vault with access control policies, foreign networks' security groups (i.e., membership providers' certificate chains), and some sample state values that can be shared during subsequent interoperation flows.

### Corda Network

The Corda networks' code lies in the `weaver/tests/network-setups/corda` folder. You can launch two separate Corda networks, namely `Corda_Network` and `Corda_Network2`. Each network runs the `weaver/samples/corda/corda-simple-application` CorDapp by default, which maintains a state named `SimpleState` containing a set of key-value pairs (of strings).

The following steps will, in addition to launching the network, build the CorDapp and a Corda client in `weaver/samples/corda/corda-simple-application/client`.

#### Running with Interoperation CorDapp from GitHub Packages

Follow the instructions below to build and launch the network:
- Navigate to the `weaver/tests/network-setups/corda` folder.
- Create copy of `github.properties.template` as `github.properties`.
- Replace `<GITHUB email>` with your GitHub email, and `<GITHUB Personal Access Token>` with the access token created [above](#package-access-token).
- To spin up the Corda networks with the Interoperation CorDapps:
  - Each consisting of 1 node and a notary (for data-transfer), run:
    ```bash
    make start
    ```
  - Each consisting of 2 nodes and a notary (for asset-exchange/transfer), run:
    ```bash
    make start PROFILE="2-nodes"
    ```
  - Each consisting of 3 nodes and a notary (for asset-exchange/transfer), run:
    ```bash
    make start PROFILE="3-nodes"
    ```

You should see the following message in the terminal:
```
Waiting for network node services to start
```
The Corda nodes and notary may take a while (several minutes on memory-constrained systems) to start. If they start up successfully, you should something like the following for each network, though the number of node entries will depend on the profile you used to start the network with (replace `<network-name>` with `Corda_Network` or `Corda_Network2`):
```bash
PartyA node services started for network <network-name>
PartyB node services started for network <network-name>
PartyC node services started for network <network-name>
Notary node services started for network <network-name>
```

### Corda Relay

Navigate to the `weaver/core/relay` folder and run a relay for `Corda_Network` and/or `Corda_Network2` in Docker container as follows:

* The `docker-compose.yaml` in this folder is minimally configured with default values. To modify it for use with the Fabric testnets, run:
  ```bash
  make convert-compose-method2
  ```
* (The `.env.corda` and `.env.corda.tls` files in the `docker/testnet-envs` directory contain environment variables used by the `Corda_Network` relay at startup and runtime.)

* (The `.env.corda2` and `.env.corda2.tls` files in the `docker/testnet-envs` directory contain environment variables used by the `Corda_Network2` relay at startup and runtime.)

* To deploy the relay server for `Corda_Network` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make start-server COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker/testnet-envs/.env.corda'
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the relay server with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make start-server COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker/testnet-envs/.env.corda.tls'
  ```
* To deploy the relay server for `Corda_Network2` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make start-server COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker/testnet-envs/.env.corda2'
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the relay server with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make start-server COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker/testnet-envs/.env.corda2.tls'
  ```
* After launching the relay(s), you can revert the `docker-compose.yaml` changes by running:
  ```bash
  make convert-compose-method1
  ```

### Corda Driver

Use the following steps to run Corda drivers in Docker containers:
- Navigate to the `weaver/core/drivers/corda-driver` folder.
- (The `.env.corda` and `.env.corda.tls` files in the `docker-testnet-envs` contain environment variables used by the `Corda_Network` driver at startup and runtime.)
- (The `.env.corda2` and `.env.corda2.tls` files in the `docker-testnet-envs` contain environment variables used by the `Corda_Network2` driver at startup and runtime.)
- To deploy the Corda driver for `Corda_Network` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet-envs/.env.corda'
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the driver with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet-envs/.env.corda.tls'
  ```
  If the driver starts successfully, it should log the following message when you run `docker logs corda-driver-Corda_Network`:
  ```
  Corda driver gRPC server started. Listening on port 9099
  ```
- To deploy the Corda driver for `Corda_Network2` without TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet-envs/.env.corda2'
  ```
  Instead, to deploy the driver with TLS, run:
  ```bash
  make deploy COMPOSE_ARG='--env-file docker-testnet-envs/.env.corda2.tls'
  ```
  If the driver starts successfully, it should log the following message when you run `docker logs corda-driver-Corda_Network2`:
  ```
  Corda driver gRPC server started. Listening on port 9098
  ```
