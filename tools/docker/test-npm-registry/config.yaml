# This is the config file used for the docker images.
# It allows all users to do anything, so don't use it on production systems.
#
# Do not configure host and port under `listen` in this file
# as it will be ignored when using docker.

# The only reason why we need a custom built docker image is because there is
# no way to configure the existing container images to have a max body size
# higher than the default 10 MB without mounting a volume with a config file
