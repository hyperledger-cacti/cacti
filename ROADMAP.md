## Can I Add Things to the Roadmap?

If you take on the burden of implementing a feature yourself no one should stop you from adding it here as well, as long as the majority of the maintainers also agree that it is something that has a place in the framework.

For example: 
* Support being added for new ledgers by implementing new connector plugins is always welcome.
* On the other hand, if you want to repurpose Cactus to be the operating system for a driverless ice-cream truck you are developing that that **may** not get accepted by the maintainers even if you are happy to do all the work yourself. 

# Breakdown by each release

### Cacti V2
- Date: 
    - Start: March 2023 (planned)
    - Expired: ****
- Goal:
    - To integrate Cactus different APIs to provide user-friendly APIs.  In detail, the goal is to combine the following strengths of existing APIs on Cactus V1 and Weaver to provide better functionality
        - c.f.: APIs on Cactus V1 
            - OpenAPI-api-client users need to use slightly different names, data types between different ledger types.
            - Verifier interface users only need to know four functions, but arguments passed to the function differs between different ledger types.
            - Weaver interface.
        - Notes: The above goal will make some of Cactus V1 features incompatibilities on Cactus V2
- Sub release
    - [V2.0-alpha] First release of the merged version of Cactus and Weaver
        - Date: November 2022 (planned)

            - Add a GUI transaction viewer tool for Hyperledger Cacti 
    - [V2.0]

        - Goal:
            - Enhance the code quality of V2.0-beta
