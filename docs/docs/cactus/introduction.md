Welcome to Hyperledger Cactus documentation!
=========================================================================================================================

Hyperledger Cactus aims to provide Decentralized, Secure and Adaptable Integration between Blockchain Networks. Hyperledger Cactus is currently undergoing a major refactoring effort to enable the desired to-be architecture which will enable plug-in based collaborative development to increase the breadth of use cases & Ledgers supported.

**What is Cactus?**

A pluggable, enterprise-grade framework to transact on multiple distributed ledgers without introducing yet another competing blockchain.

> *   Cactus allows developers to abstract the application layer from the DLT addressing protocol fragmentation, lowering coupling and reducing implementation risks​
>     
> *   Cactus allows different DLT networks to interact with each other, through atomic transactions and state commits, this eliminates information silos and increases network’s value​
>     

**Why use Cactus?**

> *   Maximize flexibility and future-proofing through plug-in architecture. ​
>     
> *   Avoid needing explicit action from users to have a secure Cactus deployment. Policies such as vaults are built into the SDK​
>     
> *   Keys and other credentials are not stored in source, configuration files, or environment variables​
>     
> *   Preserving Ledger Features Horizontal Scalability.​
