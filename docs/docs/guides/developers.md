# Developer's Guide

## Getting Started

If you're new to Cacti, start with our comprehensive **[Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md)** which covers:

- Understanding Cacti's architecture and what components are part of the framework
- Choosing the right level of integration for your project:
  - **Level 1**: Using connectors as npm dependencies (lowest barrier to entry)
  - **Level 2**: Running the API server with plugins (for non-Node.js projects)
  - **Level 3**: Full framework integration with business logic plugins
- Step-by-step tutorials for each level of immersion
