# Technical Specifications

The two legacy projects that Cacti is comprised of have independent sets of design and interface specifications, including examples of usage, as follows:

- **Cactus**: See the official [Cactus whitepaper](https://github.com/hyperledger-cacti/cacti/tree/main/whitepaper/whitepaper.md) for technical designs and usage.
- **Weaver**: See the official [Weaver RFCs](https://github.com/hyperledger-cacti/cacti/tree/main/weaver/rfcs/) for technical designs and interface specifications.

!!! note

    We will create a unified set of technical specifications for Cacti as the Cactus and Weaver modules get integrated in a deeper way following the [reference architecture](). Keep watching these pages for updates!
