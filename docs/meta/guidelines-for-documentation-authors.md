## 1. Source Control Images/Videos

- Text based assets are preferred in order to keep the git repository's size to
a minimum.
- Videos should be uploaded to popular video sharing platform(s) and linked to.
- Diagrams/Figures should be generated from their text based representations so that changes can be tracked easily without having to read binary code. (PlantUML, Mermaid, etc. are great tools for this)

## 2. Stylistic Recommendations
