Welcome to Hyperledger Cactus documentation!
==============================================

Hyperledger Cactus aims to provide Decentralized, Secure and Adaptable Integration between Blockchain Networks.
Hyperledger Cactus is currently undergoing a major refactoring effort to enable the desired to-be architecture which will enable plug-in based collaborative development to increase the breadth of use cases & Ledgers supported.

**What is Cactus?**

A pluggable, enterprise-grade framework to transact on multiple distributed ledgers without introducing yet another competing blockchain. 

   * Cactus allows developers to abstract the application layer from the DLT addressing protocol fragmentation, lowering coupling and reducing implementation risks​

   * Cactus allows different DLT networks to interact with each other, through atomic transactions and state commits, this eliminates information silos and increases network's value​


**Why use Cactus?**

   * Maximize flexibility and future-proofing through plug-in architecture. ​

   * Avoid needing explicit action from users to have a secure Cactus deployment. Policies such as vaults are built into the SDK​

   * Keys and other credentials are not stored in source, configuration files, or environment variables​

   * Preserving Ledger Features Horizontal Scalability.​
