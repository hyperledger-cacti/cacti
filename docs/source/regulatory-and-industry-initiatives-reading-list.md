# Regulatory and Industry Initiatives Reading List

A non-exhaustive list of industry standards and regulations/regulatory plans
that one could read through if they are trying to get a comprehensive picture
of what it takes from the non-technical standpoint to interoperate existing
productive systems in finance, trade and more.

While these documents are not dealing with technological problems, even just
the awareness of their existence could still add tremendous value to someone
who is looking to implement some sort of integration/interoperability between
different DLTs or a DLT and any pre-existing centralized system.
