# Cactus car-trade

## Abstract

Cactus **car-trade** is a sample application where users can exchange car ownership (represented by Fabcar chaincode tokens on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain) for ETH currency on a private Ethereum blockchain. The application takes the form of a "business logic plugin" which is a central point of our architecture.

## Required software components
- OS: Linux (CentOS7)
- Docker (recommend: v17.06.2-ce or greater)
- Docker-compose (recommend: v1.14.0 or greater)
- node.js v12 (recommend: v12.20.2 or greater)

## Prerequisites

- Available ports:
	- `5034`: the port of `cactus-cmd-socker-server`
	- `5040`: the port of `cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric-socketio`
	- `5050`: the port of `cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-go-ethereum-socketio`
	- If it is already used, the following processes can be done by changing the port number setting
- Available directory (This directory must be empty):
	- `/etc/cactus`: the directory for storing the config files of `cactus-cmd-socket-server`

## Boot method

1. Before booting, please prepare the directory for storing config files on the directoty `/etc/cactus` on your server
	```
	sudo mkdir /etc/cactus
	sudo chmod 777 /etc/cactus
	```

1. Before booting, please modify `applicationHostInfo.hostName` and `applicationHostInfo.hostPort` on `cactus/etc/cactus/default.yaml` to adjust to your environment.
	```
	vi cactus/etc/cactus/default.yaml

	[cactus/etc/cactus/default.yaml]
	applicationHostInfo:
	  hostName: http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd # please change hostName to your IP address
	  hostPort: 5034 # if you want to change the port number, please change hostPort to the port number which you want to use
	```

1. Start ledgers:
	```
	./script-start-ledgers.sh
	```
	- (NOTICE: Before executing the above, your account needs to be added to the docker group (`usermod -a -G docker YourAccount` from root user))
	- If the following containers are started when displaying the container list with the docker ps command, it will be fine.

1. Please prepare the three consoles on your machine as the following:
	- **console 1**: console for launching `cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-go-ethereum-socketio`
	- **console 2**: console for launching `cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric-socketio`
	- **console 3**: console for launching `cactus-cmd-socker-server` including `cartrade` business logic application.

1. Launch the validators:
	- Please execute [the boot methods](../../packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-go-ethereum-socketio/README.md#boot-methods) of `cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-go-ethereum-socketio` on the **console 1** using the port `5050`
	- Please execute [the boot methods](../../packages/cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric-socketio/README.md#boot-methods) of `cactus-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric-socketio` on the **console 2** using the port `5040`

2. Launch `cactus-cmd-socker-server` including `cartrade` business logic application
	- Use the **console 3**
	- Install and build npm packages on `cactus-cmd-socker-server`
		```
		cd cactus/packages/cactus-cmd-socker-server
		npm install
		npm run build
		```
	- Install and build npm packages on `cactus/examples/cartrade`
		```
		cd cactus/examples/cartrade
		npm install
		npm run build
		```
	- Create the symbolic link to node_modules. This script is enough to execute only once.
		```
		cd cactus/examples/cartrade
		npm run init-cartrade
		```
	- Launch the `cactus-cmd-server-socket` `cactus-cmd-socker-server` including `cartrade` business logic application
		```
		cd cactus/examples/cartrade
		npm run start
		```
	- After executing the above script, `cactus-cmd-socker-server` is launched on the port `5034`.

## How to use this application

1. (Optional) Check the balance on Ethereum and the fabcar ownership on Fabric using the following script
	- `./script-build-get-app.sh` (only the first time)
	- `./script-get-app.sh`
	- The result is as the following:
		```
		[process] Execute an app for getting Balance on Ethereum
		The balance of fromAccount:
		BigNumber { s: 1, e: 4, c: [ 100000 ] }
		The balance of toAccount:
		BigNumber { s: 1, e: 1, c: [ 0 ] }
		[process] Execute an app for getting ownership on Fabcar
		##queryCar Params: CAR1
		Transaction has been evaluated, result is: {"colour":"red","make":"Ford","model":"Mustang","owner":"Brad"}
		```
1. Run the transaction execution using the following script
	```
	curl localhost:5034/api/v1/bl/trades/ -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"businessLogicID":"guks32pf","tradeParams":["0x06fc56347d91c6ad2dae0c3ba38eb12ab0d72e97", "0x9d624f7995e8bd70251f8265f2f9f2b49f169c55", "Brad", "Cathy", 50, "CAR1"],"authParams":["none"]}'
	```
	- `./script-post-cartrade-sample.sh`
	- After this, the transactions are executed by order. When the following log appears on the above third console (the console of `./script-start-cartrade.sh`), the transactions are completed.
		```
		[INFO] BusinessLogicCartrade - ##INFO: completed cartrade, businessLogicID: guks32pf, tradeID: *******-001
		```
1. (Optional) Check the balance on Ethereum and the fabcar ownership on Fabric using the following script
	- `./script-get-app.sh`
	- The result is as the following. In the following case, 50 coins from fromAccount was transferred to toAccount, and the car ownership ("owner") was transferred.
		```
		[process] Execute an app for getting Balance on Ethereum
		The balance of fromAccount:
		BigNumber { s: 1, e: 4, c: [ 99950 ] }
		The balance of toAccount:
		BigNumber { s: 1, e: 1, c: [ 50 ] }
		[process] Execute an app for getting ownership on Fabcar
		##queryCar Params: CAR1
		Transaction has been evaluated, result is: {"colour":"red","make":"Ford","model":"Mustang","owner":"Cathy"}
		```

## How to stop the application and Docker containers

1. Stop the validators and `cactus-cmd-server-socket`
	- Press Ctrl+C on the above the **console 1, 2, and 3**.
1. Remove the config files on your machine
	```
	sudo rm -r /etc/cactus/
	```
1. Stop the docker containers of Ethereum and Fabric
	- Press the command `docker stop <CONTAINER ID>` to stop the container corresponding to the above containers which were launched by `./script-start-ledgers.sh` on the boot method. If you want to destroy the docker containers, press the command `docker rm <CONTAINER ID>` after the above.
	- If any other docker containers are not running on your machine, you can destroy the Docker containers only with `docker ps -aq | xargs docker stop` and `docker ps -aq | xargs docker rm`.
