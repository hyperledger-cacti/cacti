# cactus-example-discounted-asset-trade-client
- Client applications and helper libraries for interacting with test indy ledger and Cacti discounted asset trade example app.
- Uses Hyperledger Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ).
- **Before running any of the script make sure that test indy ledger is running and it's config is available under `/etc/cactus/indy-all-in-one/` (at least `pool_transactions_genesis` should be there.)**

## Build
- This package will be build as part of main cacti build (`yarn run configure` in root dir), or can be build manually by running `yarn run build` from this directory).

## Setup Credentials Script
- This script can be used to setup indy credentials before running the example app, or to simply check indy test ledger operational status.
- Script will register employment credential, issue it to agent `Alice`, and check that employment proof is correct.
- Can be run repeatadelly.

``` bash
# Run the script
yarn setup-credentials

# Run with debug logs
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG yarn setup-credentials
```

## Discounted Asset Trade Client
- Used to interact with discounted asset trade example application.
- Will connect Alice agent to sample application. After that you can choose action to perform.
- Actions:
    - `Start the trade`: Will send trade request to example app, asset2 will change owner and payment will be processed on etherem (see `cactus-example-discounted-asset-trade` README for more details)
    - `Get this agent credentials`: Get list of Alice credentials.
    - `Get assets`: Get example app asset list (both fabric assets and ethereum balances)
    - `Exit`: Cleanup and leave. Note - may take few seconds due to ongoing timeouts etc...
- Note: Use arrow keys to restore menu if any async message caused it to disappear.

``` bash
# Run the script
yarn run-discounted-asset-trade-client

# Run with debug logs
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG yarn run-discounted-asset-trade-client
