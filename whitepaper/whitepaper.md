# 1. Abstract

Blockchain technologies are growing in usage, but fragmentation is a big problem that may hinder reaching critical levels of adoption in the future.

We propose a protocol and it's implementation to connect as many of them as possible in an attempt to solve the fragmentation problem by creating a heterogeneous system architecture <sup>[1](#7-references)</sup>.

# 2. Example Use Cases

Specific use cases that we intend to support.
The core idea is to support as many use-cases as possible by enabling interoperability
between a large variety of ledgers specific to certain mainstream or exotic use cases.

## 2.1 Ethereum to Quorum Asset Transfer

| Use Case                   | 1. `User A` owns some assets on a Ethereum ledger<br>2. `User A` asks `Exchanger` to exchange specified amount of assets on Ethereum ledger, and receives exchanged asset at the Quorum ledger.

| Narrative                  | A person (`User A`) has multiple accounts on different ledgers (Ethereum, Quorum) and he wishes to send some assets from Ethereum ledger to a Quorum ledger with considering conversion rate. The sent asset on Ethereum will be received by Exchanger only when he successfully received converted asset on Quorum ledger. |
| Actors                     | 1. `User A`: The person or entity who has ownership of the assets asscociated with its accounts on ledger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Goals of Actors            | `User A` loses ownership of sent assets on Ethereum, but he will get ownnership of exchanged asset value on Quorum.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Success Scenario           | Transfer succeeds without issues. Asset is available on both Ethereum and Quorum ledgers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Success Criteria           | Transfer asset on Quorum was successed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Use Case                    | 1. `User A` initiates (proposes) an escrowed transaction with `User B`<br>2. `User A` places funds, `User B` places the data to a digital escrow service.<br>3. They both observe each other's input to the escrow service and decide to proceed.<br>4. Escrow service releases the funds and the data to the parties in the exchange. |
| Type of Social Interaction  | Peer to Peer Exchange |
| Narrative                   | Data in this context is any series of bits stored on a computer:<br> * Machine learning model<br> * ad-tech database<br> * digital/digitized art<br> * proprietary source code or binaries of software<br> * etc.<br><br>`User A` and B trade the data and the funds through a Hyperledger Cactus transaction in an atomic swap with escrow securing both parties from fraud or unintended failures.<br>Through the transaction protocol's handshake mechanism, A and B can agree (in advance) upon<br><br>* The delivery addresses (which ledger, which wallet)<br>* the provider of escrow that they both trust<br>* the price and currency<br><br>Establishing trust (e.g. Is that art original or is that machine learning model has the advertised accuracy) can be facilitated through the participating DLTs if they support it. Note that `User A` has no way of knowing the quality of the dataset, they entirely rely on `User B`'s description of its quality (there are solutions to this problem, but it's not within the scope of our use case to discuss these). |
| Actors                      | 1. `User A`: A person or business organization with the intent to purchase data.<br>2. `User B`: A person or business entity with data to sell. |
| Goals of Actors             | `User A` wants to have access to data for an arbitrary reason such as having a business process that can enhanced by it.<br> `User B`: Is looking to generate income/profits from data they have obtained/created/etc. |
| Success Scenario            | Both parties have signaled to proceed with escrow and the swap happened as specified in advance. |
| Success Criteria            | `User A` has access to the data, `User B` has been provided with the funds. |
| Failure Criteria            | Either party did not hold up their end of the exchange/trace. |
| Prerequisites               | `User A` has the funds to make the purchase<br>`User B` has the data that `User A` wishes to purchase.<br>`User A` and B can agree on a suitable currency to denominate the deal in and there is also consensus on the provider of escrow. |

| W3C Use Case Attribute Name | W3C Use Case Attribute Value |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Use Case Title              | Stable Coin Pegged to Other Currency |
| Use Case                    | 1. `User A` creates their own ledger<br>2. `User A` deploys Hyperledger Cactus in an environment set up by them.<br>3. `User A` implements necessary plugins for Hyperledger Cactus to interface with their ledger for transactions, token minting and burning.|
| Type of Social Interaction  | Software Implementation Project |
| Narrative                   | Someone launches a highly scalable ledger with their own coin called ExampleCoin that can consistently sustain throughput levels of a million transactions per second reliably, but they struggle with adoption because nobody wants to buy into their coin fearing that it will lose its value. They choose to put in place a two-way peg with Bitcoin which guarantees to holders of their coin that it can always be redeemed for a fixed number of Bitcoins/USDs. |
| Actors                      | `User A`: Owner and/or operator of a ledger and currency that they wish to stabilize (peg) to other currencies |
| Goals of Actors             | 1. Achieve credibility for their currency by backing funds.<br>2. Implement necessary software with minimal boilerplate code (most of which should be provided by Hyperldger Cactus) |
| Success Scenario            | `User A` stood up a Hyperledger Cactus deployment with their self-authored plugins and it is possible for end user application development to start by leveraging the Hyperledger Cactus REST APIs which now expose the functionalities provided by the plugin authored by ``User A`` |
| Success Criteria            | Success scenario was achieved without significant extra development effort apart from creating the Hyperledger Cactus plugins. |
| Failure Criteria            | Implementation complexity was high enough that it would've been easier to write something from scratch without the framework |
| Prerequisites               | * Operational ledger and currency<br>*Technical knowledge for plugin implementation (software engineering) |
| Comments                    | |

### 2.4.1 With Permissionless Ledgers (BTC)

A BTC holder can exchange their BTC for ExampleCoins by sending their BTC to `ExampleCoin Reserve Wallet` and the equivalent amount of coins get minted for them
onto their ExampleCoin wallet on the other network.

An ExampleCoin holder can redeem their funds to BTC by receiving a Proof of Burn on the ExampleCoin ledger and getting sent the matching amount of BTC from the `ExampleCoin Reserve Wallet` to their BTC wallet.

### 2.4.2 With Fiat Money (USD)

Very similar idea as with pegging against BTC, but the BTC wallet used for reserves
gets replaced by a traditional bank account holding USD.

## 2.5 Healthcare Data Sharing with Access Control Lists

| W3C Use Case Attribute Name | W3C Use Case Attribute Value |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Use Case Title              | Healthcare Data Sharing with Access Control Lists |
| Use Case                    | 1. `User A` (patient) engages in business with `User B` (healthcare provider)<br>2. `User B` requests permission to have read access to digitally stored medical history of `User A` and write access to log new entries in said medical history.<br>3.`User A` receives a prompt to grant access and allows it.<br>4. `User B` is granted permission through ledger specific access control/privacy features to the data of `User A`. |
| Type of Social Interaction  | Peer to Peer Data Sharing |
| Narrative                   | Let's say that two healthcare providers have both implemented their own blockchain based patient data management systems and are looking to integrate with each other to provide patients with a seamless experience when being directed from one to another for certain treatments. The user is in control over their data on both platforms separately and with a Hyperledger Cactus backed integration they could also define fine grained access control lists consenting to the two healthcare providers to access each other's data that they collected about the patient. |
| Actors                      | * `User A`: Patient engaging in business with a healthcare provider<br>* `User B`: Healthcare provider offering services to `User A`. Some of said services depend on having access to prior medical history of `User A`. |
| Goals of Actors             | * `User A`: Wants to have fine grained access control in place when it comes to sharing their data to ensure that it does not end up in the hands of hackers or on a grey data market place.<br>`User B` |
| Success Scenario            | `User B` (healthcare provider) has access to exactly as much information as they need to and nothing more. |
| Success Criteria            | There's cryptographic proof for the integrity of the data. Data hasn't been compromised during the sharing process, e.g. other actors did not gain unauthorized access to the data by accident or through malicious actions. |
| Failure Criteria            | `User B` (healthcare provider) either does not have access to the required data or they have access to data that they are not supposed to. |
| Prerequisites               | `User A` and `User B` are registered on a ledger or two separate ledgers that support the concept of individual data ownership, access controls and sharing. |
| Comments                    | It makes most sense for best privacy if `User A` and `User B` are both present with an identity on the same permissioned, privacy-enabled ledger rather than on two separate ones. This gives `User A` an additional layer of security since they can know that their data is still only stored on one ledger instead of two (albeit both being privacy-enabled)|

## 2.6 Integrate Existing Food Traceability Solutions

| W3C Use Case Attribute Name | W3C Use Case Attribute Value |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Use Case Title              | Food Traceability Integration |
| Use Case                    | 1. `Consumer` is evaluating a food item in a physical retail store.<br> 2. `Consumer` queries the designated end user application designed to provide food traces. 3. `Consumer` makes purchasing decision based on food trace.|
| Type of Social Interaction  | Software Implementation Project |
| Narrative                   | Both `Organization A` and `Organization B` have separate products/services for solving the problem of verifying the source of food products sold by retailers.<br>A retailer has purchased the food traceability solution from `Organization A` while a food manufacturer (whom the retailer is a customer of) has purchased their food traceability solution from `Organization B`.<br>The retailer wants to provide end to end food traceability to their customers, but this is not possible since the chain of traceability breaks down at the manufacturer who uses a different service or solution. `Cactus` is used as an architectural component to build an integration for the retailer which ensures that consumers have access to food tracing data regardless of the originating system for it being the product/service of `Organization A` or `Organization B`. |
| Actors                      | `Organization A`, `Organization B` entities whose business has to do with food somewhere along the global chain from growing/manufacturing to the consumer retail shelves.<br> `Consumer`: Private citizen who makes food purchases in a consumer retail goods store and wishes to trace the food end to end before purchasing decisions are finalized. |
| Goals of Actors             | `Organization A`, `Organization B`: Provide `Consumer` with a way to trace food items back to the source.<br>`Consumer`: Consume food that's been ethically sourced, treated and transported. |
| Success Scenario            | `Consumer` satisfaction increases on account of the ability to verify food origins. |
| Success Criteria            | `Consumer` is able to verify food items' origins before making a purchasing decision. |
| Failure Criteria            | `Consumer` is unable to verify food items' origins partially or completely. |
| Prerequisites               | 1. `Organization A` and `Organization B` are both signed up for blockchain enabled software services that provide end to end food traceability solutions on their own but require all participants in the chain to use a single solution in order to work.<br>2. Both solutions of `Organization A` and `B` have terms and conditions such that it is possible technically and legally to integrate the software with each other and `Cactus`. |

| Use Case Title              | Wallet Authentication/Authorization |
| Use Case                    | 1. `User A` has separate identities on different permissioned and permissionless ledgers in the form of private/public key pairs (Public Key Infrastructure).<br>2. `User A` wishes to access/manage these identities through a single API or user interface and opts to on-board the identities to a `Cactus` deployment.<br>3. `User A` performs the on-boarding of identities and is now able to interact with wallets attached to said identities through `Cactus` or end user applications that leverage `Cactus` under the hood (e.g. either by directly issuing API requests or using an application that does so.|
| Type of Social Interaction  | Identity Management |
| Narrative                   | End user facing applications can provide a seamless experience connecting multiple permissioned (or permissionless) networks for an end user who has a set of different identity proofs for wallets on different ledgers. |
| Actors                      | `User A`: The person or entity whose identities get consolidated within a single `Cactus` deployment |
| Goals of Actors             | `User A`: Convenient way to manage an array of distinct identities with the trade-off that a `Cactus` deployment must be trusted with the private keys of the identities involved (an educated decision on the user's part). |
| Success Scenario            | `User A` is able to interact with their wallets without having to access each private key individually. |
| Success Criteria            | `User A`'s credentials are safely stored in the `Cactus` keychain component where it is the least likely that they will be compromised (note that it is never impossible, but least unlikely, definitely) |
| Failure Criteria            | `User A` is unable to import identities to `Cactus` for a number of different reasons such as key format incompatibilities. |
| Prerequisites               | 1. `User A` has to have the identities on the various ledgers set up prior to importing them and must have access to the private |

| Narrative                  | A group of members (`Consortium A`) are operating a source blockchain (e.g., a Hyperledger Fabric instance) would like to migrate the functionality to a target blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Besu), in order to expand their reach. However, such migration requires lots of resources and technical effort. The `Blockchain Migration feature` from Hyperledger Cactus can provide support for doing so, by connecting to the source and target blockchains, and performing the migration task.
| Actors                     | 1. Consortium members composing the `Consortium A`: The group of entities operating the source blockchain, who collectively aim at performing a migration to a target blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Goals of Actors            | `Consortium A` wishes to be able to operate their use case on the target blockchain. The service is functional after the migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Success Scenario           | The consortium agrees on the migration, and it is performed in a decentralized way. Blockchain migration succeeds without issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Success Criteria           | Assets have been migrated. An identical history for those assets has been reconstructed on the target blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Motivation: The suitability of a blockchain solution regarding a use case depends on the underlying blockchain properties.
            As blockchain technologies are maturing at a fast pace, in particular private blockchains, its properties might change. Consequently, this creates an unbalance between user expectations' and the applicability of the solution.
            It is, therefore, desirable for an organization to be able to replace the blockchain providing the infrastructure to a certain service.

Currently, when a consortium wants to migrate their blockchain (e.g., the source blockchain became obsolete, cryptographic algorithms no longer secure, etc), the solution is to re-implement business logic using a different platform, yielding great effort.
Data migrations have been performed before on public blockchains [[2](#7-references),[3](#7-references)], both recent endeavors to render flexibility to blockchain-based solutions.
In those works, the authors propose simple data migration capabilities for public, permissionless blockchains, in which a user can specify requirements for the blockchain infrastructure supporting their service.

### 2.8.1 Blockchain Data Migration
Data migration corresponds to capture the set or subset of data assets (information, in the form of bytes) on a source blockchain, and construct a representation of those in a target blockchain. Note that the models underlying both blockchains do not need to be the same (e.g., world state model in Hyperledger Fabric vs account model in Ethereum).
To migrate data, it should be possible to capture the necessary information from the source blockchain and to write it on the target blockchain. The history of information should also be migrated (i.e., the updates over the elements considered information).


<img width="700" src="./use-case-sequence-diagram-blockchain-migration.png">

### 2.8.2 Blockchain Smart Contract Migration
The task of migrating a smart contract comprises the task of migrating data. In specific, the information should be accessible and writeable on another blockchain. Additionally, the target blockchain's virtual machine should support the computational complexity of the source blockchain (e.g., one cannot migrate all Ethereum smart contracts to Bitcoin, but the other way around is feasible).

Automatic smart contract migration yields risks for enterprise blockchain systems, and thus the solution is non-trivial.

### 2.8.3 Semi-Automatic Blockchain Migration

By expressing my preferences in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, Hyperledger Cactus can recommend a set of suitable blockchains, as the target of the migration.
Firstly, I could know in real-time the characteristics of the target blockchain that would influence my decision.
For instance, the platform can analyze see the cost of writing information to Ethereum, the exchange rate US dollar - Ether, the average time to mine a block, the transaction throughput, and the network hash rate [[3](#7-references)</sup>].
Based on that, the framework proposes a migration, with indicators such as predicted cost, predicted time to complete migration and the likelihood of success.
As Ethereum does not show a desirable throughput, I choose Polkadot's platform. As it yields higher throughput, I then safely migrate my solution from Fabric to Polkadot, without compromising the solution in production.
 This feature is more useful regarding public blockchains.

# 3. Software Design

## 3.1. Principles

### 3.1.1. Wide support

Interconnect as many ecosystems as possible regardless of technology limitations

### 3.1.2. Plugin Architecture from all possible aspects

Identities, DLTs, service discovery. Minimize how opinionated we are to really embrace interoperability rather than silos and lock-in. Closely monitor community feedback/PRs to determine points of contention where core Hyperledger Cactus code could be lifted into plugins.  Limit friction to adding future use cases and protocols.

### 3.1.3. Prevent Double spending Where Possible

Two representations of the same asset do not exist across the ecosystems at the same time unless clearly labelled as such [As of Oct 30 limited to specific combinations of DLTs; e.g. not yet possible with Fabric + Bitcoin]

### 3.1.4 DLT Feature Inclusivity

Each DLT has certain unique features that are partially or completely missing from other DLTs.
Hyperledger Cactus - where possible - should be designed in a way so that these unique features are accessible even when interacting with a DLT through Hyperledger Cactus. A good example of this principle in practice would be Kubernetes CRDs and operators that allow the community to extend the Kubernetes core APIs in a reusable way.

### 3.1.5 Low impact

Interoperability does not redefine ecosystems but adapts to them. Governance, trust model and workflows are preserved in each ecosystem
Trust model and consensus must be a mandatory part of the protocol handshake so that any possible incompatibilities are revealed up front and in a transparent way and both parties can “walk away” without unintended loss of assets/data.
The idea comes from how the traditional online payment processing APIs allow merchants to specify the acceptable level of guarantees before the transaction can be finalized (e.g. need pin, signed receipt, etc.).
Following the same logic, we shall allow transacting parties to specify what sort of consensus, transaction finality, they require.
Consensus requirements must support predicates, e.g. “I am on Fabric, but will accept Bitcoin so long X number of blocks were confirmed post-transaction”
Requiring KYC (Know Your Customer) compliance could also be added to help foster adoption as much as possible.

### 3.1.6 Transparency

Cross-ecosystem transfer participants are made aware of the local and global implications of the transfer. Rejection and errors are communicated in a timely fashion to all participants.
Such transparency should be visible as trustworthy evidence.

### 3.1.7 Automated workflows

Logic exists in each ecosystem to enable complex interoperability use-cases. Cross-ecosystem transfers can be automatically triggered in response to a previous one.
Automated procedure, which is regarding error recovery and exception handling, should be executed without any interruption.

### 3.1.8 Default to Highest Security

Support less secure options, but strictly as opt-in, never opt-out.

### 3.1.9 Transaction Protocol Negotiation

Participants in the transaction must have a handshake mechanism where they agree on one of the supported protocols to use to execute the transaction. The algorithm looks an intersection in the list of supported algorithms by the participants.

### 3.1.10 Avoid modifying the total amount of digital assets on any blockchain whenever possible

We believe that increasing or decreasing the total amount of digital assets might weaken the security of blockchain, since adding or deleting assets will be complicated. Instead, intermediate entities (e.g. exchanger) can pool and/or send the transfer.

### 3.1.11 Provide abstraction for common operations

Our communal modularity should extend to common mechanisms to operate and/or observe transactions on blockchains.

### 3.1.12 Integration with Identity Frameworks (Moonshot)

Do not expend opinions on identity frameworks just allow users of `Cactus` to leverage the most common ones and allow for future expansion of the list of supported identity frameworks through the plugin architecture.
Allow consumers of `Cactus` to perform authentication, authorization and reading/writing of credentials.

Identity Frameworks to support/consider initially:

* [Hyperledger Indy (Sovrin)](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy)
* [DIF](https://identity.foundation/)
* [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)

## 3.2 Feature Requirements

### 3.2.1 New Protocol Integration

Adding new protocols must be possible as part of the plugin architecture allowing the community to propose, develop, test and release their own implementations at will.

### 3.2.2 Proxy/Firewall/NAT Compatibility

Means for establishing bidirectional communication channels through proxies/firewalls/NAT wherever possible

### 3.2.3 Bi-directional Communications Layer

Using a blockchain agnostic bidirectional communication channel for controlling and monitoring transactions on blockchains through proxies/firewalls/NAT wherever possible.
   * Blockchains vary on their P2P communication protocols. It is better to build a modular method for sending/receiving generic transactions between trustworthy entities on blockchains.

### 3.2.4 Consortium Management

Consortiums can be formed by cooperating entities (person, organization, etc.) who wish to all contribute hardware/network resources to the operation of a `Cactus` cluster (set of validator nodes, API servers, etc.).

After the forming of the consortium with it's initial set of members (one or more) it is possible to enroll or remove certain new or existing members.

`Cactus` does not prescribe any specific consensus algorithm for the addition or removal of consortium members, but rather focuses on the technical side of making it possible to operate a cluster of nodes under the ownership of separate entities without downtime while also keeping it possible to add/remove members.

A newly joined consortium member does not have to participate in every component of `Cactus`: Running a validator node is the only required action to participate, etcd, API server can remain the same as prior to the new member joining.

## 3.3 Working Policies

1. Participants can insist on a specific protocol by pretending that they only support said protocol only.
2. Protocols can be versioned as the specifications mature
3. The two initially supported protocols shall be the ones that can satisfy the requirements for Fujitsu's and Accenture's implementations respectively

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"><!-- \pagebreak --></div>

# 4. Architecture

## 4.1 Integration patterns

Hyperledger Cactus has several integration patterns as the following.

- Note: In the following description, **Value (V)** means numerical assets (e.g. money). **Data (D)** means non-numerical assets (e.g. ownership proof). Ledger 1 is source ledger, Ledger 2 is destination ledger.

| No. | Name                | Pattern | Consistency                                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.  | value transfer      | V -> V  | check if V1 = V2 <br> (as V1 is value on ledger 1, V2 is value on ledger 2)                    |
| 2.  | value-data transfer | V -> D  | check if data transfer is successful when value is transferred                                 |
| 3.  | data-value transfer | D -> V  | check if value transfer is successful when data is transferred                                 |
| 4.  | data transfer       | D -> D  | check if all D1 is copied on ledger 2 <br> (as D1 is data on ledger 1, D2 is data on ledger 2) |
| 5.  | data merge          | D <-> D | check if D1 = D2 as a result <br> (as D1 is data on ledger 1, D2 is data on ledger 2)          |

## 4.2 System architecture and basic flow

Hyperledger Cactus will provide integrated service(s) by executing ledger operations across multiple blockchain ledgers. The execution of operations are controlled by the module of Hyperledger Cactus which will be provided by vendors as the single Hyperledger Cactus Business Logic plugin.
The supported blockchain platforms by Hyperledger Cactus can be added by implementing new Hyperledger Cactus Ledger plugin.
Once an API call to Hyperledger Cactus framework is requested by a User, Business Logic plugin determines which ledger operations should be executed, and it ensures reliability on the issued integrated service is completed as expected.
Following diagram shows the architecture of Hyperledger Cactus based on the discussion made at Hyperledger Cactus project calls.
The overall architecture is as the following figure.

<img src="./architecture-with-plugin-and-routing.png" width="700">

### 4.2.1 Definition of key components in system architecture

Key components are defined as follows:
- **Application user**: The entity submits API calls to "Cactus Routing Interface". Note: this component is exist outside of Cactus service system.
- **Business Logic Plugin**: The entity executes business logic and provide integration services that are connected with multiple blockchains. The entity is composed by web application or smart contract on a blockchain. The entity is a single plugin and required for executing Hyperledger Cactus applications.
- **Ledger Plugin**: The entity communicates Business Logic Plugin with each ledger.  The entity is composed by a validator and a verifier as follows. The entity(s) is(are) chosen from multiple plugins on configuration.
- **Validator**: The entity monitors transaction records of Ledger operation, and it determines the result(success, failed, timeouted) from the transaction records.
Validator ensure the determined result with attaching digital signature with "Validator key" which can be verified by "Verifier".
- **Verifier**: The entity accepts only sucussfully verified operation results by verifying the digital signature of the validator. Note that "Validator" is apart from "Verifier" over a bi-directional channel.
- **Cactus Routing Interface**: The entity is a routing service between "Business Logic Plugin" and  "Ledger Plugin(s)". The entity is also a routing service between Business Logic Plugin and API calls from "Application user(s)".
- **Ledger-n**: DLT platforms(e.g. Ethereum, Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, ...)

### 4.2.2 Bootstrapping Cactus application

Key components defined in 4.2.1 becomes ready to serve Cactus application service after  following procedures:
1. Start `Validator`: The `Validator` of `Ledger Plugin` which is chosen for each `Ledger` depending the platform technology used (ex. Fabric, Besu, etc.) will be started by the administrator of `Validator`. `Validator` becomes ready status to accept connection from `Verifier` after initialization process is done.
2. Start `Business Logic Plugin` implementation: The administrator of Cactus application service starts `Business Logic Plugin` which is implemented to execute business logic(s). `Business Logic Plugin` implementation first checks availability of depended `Ledger Plugin(s)`, then it trys to enable each `Ledger Plugin` with customized profile for actual integrating `Ledger`. This availability checks also covers determination on the status of connectivity from `Verifier` to `Validator`. The availability of each `Ledger` is registered and maintained at `Cactus Routing Interface`, and it allows bi-directional message communication between `Business Logic Plugin` and `Ledger`.

### 4.2.3 Processing Service API call

 `Service API call` is processed as follows:
- **Step 1**: "Application user(s)" submits an API call to "Cactus routing interface".
- **Step 2**: The API call is internally routed to "Business Logic Plugin" by "Cactus Routing Interface" for initiating associated business logic.
Then, "Business Logic Plugin" determines required ledger operation(s) to complete or abort a business logic.
- **Step 3**" "Business Logic Plugin" submits API calls to request operations on "Ledger(s)" wrapped with "Ledger Plugin(s)". Each API call will be routed to designated "Ledger Plugin" by "Routing Interface".
- **Step 4**: "Ledger Plugin" sends an event notification to "Business Logic Plugin" via "Cactus Routing Interface", when its sub-component "Verifier" detect an event regarding requested ledger operation to "Ledger".
- **Step 5**: "Business Logic Plugin" receives a message from "Ledger Plugin" and determines completion or continuous of the business logic. When the business logic requires to continuous operations go to "Step 3" ,or end the process.

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"><!-- \pagebreak --></div>

## 4.3 APIs and communication protocols between Cactus components

API for Service Application, communication protocol for business logic plugin to interact with "Ledger Plugins" will be described in this section.

### 4.3.1 Cactus Service API

Cactus Service API is exposed to Application user(s). This API is used to request for initializing a business logic which is implemented at **Business Logic Plugin**. It is also used for making inquery of execution status and final result if the business logic is completed.

Following RESTful API design manner, the request can be mapped to one of CRUD operation with associated resource 'trade'.

The identity of User Application is authenticated and is applied for access control rule(s) check which is implemented as part of **Business Logic Plugin**.

NOTE: we are still open to consider other choose on API design patterns, such as gRPC or GraphQL.

#### Open Endpoints

Open endpoints require no authentication

* [Login](login.md) : `POST /api/v1/bl/login`

#### Restricted Endpoints

Restricted endpoints requre a valid Token to be included in the headder of the request. A Token can be acquired by calling [Login]().

* [Request Execution of Trade(instance of business logic)]() : `POST /api/v1/bl/trades/`

### 4.3.2 Ledger plugin API

Ledger plugin API is designed for allowing **Business Logic Plugin** to operate and/or monitor Ledger behind **Validator** component.

Each **Ledger plugin** can be implemented to provide common API which absorbs difference between integrating blockchain platforms.
The developper can focus on implementing business logic of **Business Logic Plugin** in applicatio level once **Ledger plugin** for specific platform, ex. HLF or Besu, was implemented.

APIs of Verifier and Validator are described as the following table:


| No. | Component | API Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | BLP -> Verifier | requestLedgerOperation | Request a verifier to execute a ledger operation |
| 2. | BLP -> Verifier | getApiList | Get the list of available APIs on Verifier |
| 3. | BLP -> Verifier | startMonitor | Request a verifier to start monitoring ledger |
| 4. | BLP -> Verifier | stopMonitor | Rrequest a verifier to stop monitoring ledger |
| 5. | Validator -> Verifier | connect | request a validator to start a bi-directional communication channel |
| 6. | Validator -> Verifier | disconnect | request a validator to stop a bi-directional communication channel |
| 7. | Validator -> Verifier | getVerifierInformation | Get the verifier information including version, name, ID, and other information |
| 8. | Verifier -> Validator | getValidatorInformation | Get the validator information including version, name, ID, and other information |

The detail information is described as following:

### 4.3.3 Exection of "business logic" at "Business Logic Plugin"

The developper of **Business Logic Plugin** can implement business logic(s) as codes to interact with **Ledger Plugin**.
The interaction between **Business Logic Plugin** and **Ledger Plugin** includes:
- Submit a transaction request on targeted **Ledger Plugin**
- Make a inquery to targeted **Ledger Plugin** (ex. account balance inquery)
- Receive an event message, which contains transaction/inquery result(s) or error from **Ledger Plugin**

NOTE: The transaction request is prepared by **Business Logic Plugin** using transaction template with given parameters

The communication protocol between Business Logic Plugin, Verifier, and Validator as following:

## 4.4 Technical Architecture

### 4.4.1 Monorepo Packages

Hyperledger Cactus is divided into a set of npm packages that can be compiled separately or all at once.

All packages have a prefix of `cactus-*` to avoid potential naming conflicts with npm modules published by other Hyperledger projects. For example if both Cactus and Aries were to publish a package named `common` under the shared `@hyperledger` npm scope then the resulting fully qualified package name would end up being (without the prefix) as `@hyperledger/common` but with prefixes the conflict can be resolved as `@hyperledger/cactus-common` and `@hyperledger/aries-common`. Aries is just as an example here, we do not know if they plan on releasing packages under such names, but it also does not matter for the demonstration of ours.

Naming conventions for packages:
* cmd-* for packages that ship their own executable
* sdk-* for packages designed to be used directly by application developers except for the Javacript SDK which is named just `sdk` for simplicity.
* All other packages should be named preferably as a single English word suggesting the most important feature/responsibility of the package itself.

#### 4.4.1.1 cmd-api-server

A command line application for running the API server that provides a unified REST based HTTP API for calling code.
Contains the kernel of Hyperledger Cactus.
Code that is strongly opinionated lives here, the rest is pushed to other packages that implement plugins or define their interfaces.
Comes with Swagger API definitions, plugin loading built-in.

> By design this is stateless and horizontally scalable.

**The main responsibilities of this package are:**

##### 4.4.1.1.1 Runtime Configuration Parsing and Validation

The core package is responsible for parsing runtime configuration from the usual sources (shown in order of precedence):
* Explicit instructions via code (`config.setHttpPort(3000);`)
* Command line arguments (`--http-port=3000`)
* Operating system environment variables (`HTTP_PORT=3000`)
* Static configuration files (config.json: `{ "httpPort": 3000 }`)

The Apache 2.0 licensed node-convict library to be leveraged for the mechanical parts of the configuration parsing and validation: https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict

##### 4.4.1.1.2 Configuration Schema - API Server

To obtain the latest configuration options you can check out the latest source code of Cactus and then run this from the root folder of the project on a machine that has at least NodeJS 10 or newer installed:

```sh
$ date
Mon 18 May 2020 05:09:58 PM PDT

$ npx ts-node -e "import {ConfigService} from './packages/cactus-cmd-api-server/src/main/typescript/config/config-service'; console.log(ConfigService.getHelpText());"

Order of precedent for parameters in descdending order: CLI, Environment variables, Configuration file.
Passing "help" as the first argument prints this message and also dumps the effective configuration.

```

##### 4.4.1.1.3 Plugin Loading/Validation

Plugin loading happens through NodeJS's built-in module loader and the validation is performed by the Node Package Manager tool (npm) which verifies the byte level integrity of all installed modules.

#### 4.4.1.2 core-api

Contains interface definitions for the plugin architecture and other system level components that are to be shared among many other packages.
`core-api` is intended to be a leaf package meaning that it shouldn't depend on other packages in order to make it safe for any and all packages to depend on `core-api` without having to deal with circular dependency issues.

#### 4.4.1.3 sdk

Javascript SDK (bindings) for the RESTful HTTP API provided by `cmd-api-server`.
Compatible with both NodeJS and Web Browser (HTML 5 DOM + ES6) environments.

#### 4.4.1.4 keychain

Responsible for persistently storing highly sensitive data (e.g. private keys) in an encrypted format.

For further details on the API surface, see the relevant section under `Plugin Architecture`.

#### 4.4.1.5 tracing

Contains components for tracing, logging and application performance management (APM) of code written for the rest of the Hyperledger Cactus packages.

#### 4.4.1.6 audit

Components useful for writing and reading audit records that must be archived longer term and immutable.
The latter properties are what differentiates audit logs from tracing/logging messages which are designed to be ephemeral and to support technical issues not regulatory/compliance/governance related issues.

#### 4.4.1.7 document-storage

Provides structured or unstructured document storage and analytics capabilities for other packages such as `audit` and `tracing`.
Comes with its own API surface that serves as an adapter for different storage backends via plugins.
By default, `Open Distro for ElasticSearch` is used as the storage backend: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-open-distro-for-elasticsearch/

## 4.5 Transaction Protocol Specification

### 4.5.1 Handshake Mechanism

TBD

### 4.5.2 Transaction Protocol Negotiation

Participants in the transaction must have a handshake mechanism where they agree on one of the supported protocols to use to execute the transaction. The algorithm looks an intersection in the list of supported algorithms by the participants.

Participants can insist on a specific protocol by pretending that they only support said protocol only.
Protocols can be versioned as the specifications mature.
Adding new protocols must be possible as part of the plugin architecture allowing the community to propose, develop, test and release their own implementations at will.
The two initially supported protocols shall be the ones that can satisfy the requirements for Fujitsu’s and Accenture’s implementations respectively.
Means for establishing bi-directional communication channels through proxies/firewalls/NAT wherever possible

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"><!-- \pagebreak --></div>

## 4.6 Plugin Architecture

Since our goal is integration, it is critical that `Cactus` has the flexibility of supporting most ledgers, even those that don't exist today.

> A plugin is a self contained piece of code that implements a predefined interface pertaining to a specific functionality of `Cactus` such as transaction execution.

Plugins are an abstraction layer on top of the core components that allows operators of `Cactus` to swap out implementations at will.

> Backward compatibility is important, but versioning of the plugins still follows the semantic versioning convention meaning that major upgrades can have breaking changes.

Plugins are implemented as ES6 modules (source code) that can be loaded at runtime from the persistent data store. The core package is responsible for validating code signatures to guarantee source code integrity.

An overarching theme for all aspects that are covered by the plugin architecture is that there should be a dummy implementation for each aspect to allow the simplest possible deployments to happen on a single, consumer grade machine rather than requiring costly hardware and specialized knowledge.

> Ideally, a fully testable/operational (but not production ready) `Cactus` deployment could be spun up on a developer laptop with a single command (an npm script for example).

### 4.6.1 Ledger Connector Plugins

Success is defined as:
1. Adding support in `Cactus` for a ledger invented in the future requires no `core` code changes, but instead can be implemented by simply adding a corresponding connector plugin to deal with said newly invented ledger.
2. Client applications using the REST API and leveraging the feature checks can remain 100% functional regardless of the number and nature of deployed connector plugins in `Cactus`. For example: a generic money sending application does not have to hardcode the supported ledgers it supports because the unified REST API interface (fed by the ledger connector plugins) guarantees that supported features will be operational.

Because the features of different ledgers can be very diverse, the plugin interface has feature checks built into allowing callers/client applications to **determine programmatically, at runtime** if a certain feature is supported or not on a given ledger.

```typescript
export interface LedgerConnector {
  // method to verify a signature coming from a given ledger that this connector is responsible for connecting to.
  verifySignature(message, signature): Promise<boolean>;

  // used to call methods on smart contracts or to move assets between wallets
  transact(transactions: Transaction[]);

  getPermissionScheme(): Promise<PermissionScheme>;

  getTransactionFinality(): Promise<TransactionFinality>;

}

export enum TransactionFinality {
  GUARANTEED = "GUARANTEED",
  NOT_GUARANTEED = "NOT_GUARANTEED
}

export enum PermissionScheme {
  PERMISSIONED = "PERMISSIONED",
  PERMISSIONLESS = "PERMISSIONLESS"
}

```

### 4.6.2 Identity Federation Plugins

Identity federation plugins operate inside the API Server and need to implement the interface of a common PassportJS Strategy:
https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-strategy#implement-authentication

```typescript
abstract class IdentityFederationPlugin {
  constructor(options: any): IdentityFederationPlugin;
  abstract authenticate(req: ExpressRequest, options: any);
  abstract success(user, info);
  abstract fail(challenge, status);
  abstract redirect(url, status);
  abstract pass();
  abstract error(err);
}
```

#### 4.6.2.1 X.509 Certificate Plugin

The X.509 Certificate plugin facilitates clients authentication by allowing them to present a certificate instead of operating with authentication tokens.
This technically allows calling clients to assume the identities of the validator nodes through the REST API without having to have access to the signing private key of said validator node.

PassportJS already has plugins written for client certificate validation, but we go one step further with this plugin by providing the option to obtain CA certificates from the validator nodes themselves at runtime.

### 4.6.3 Key/Value Storage Plugins

Key/Value Storage plugins allow the higher-level packages to store and retrieve configuration metadata for a `Cactus` cluster such as:
* Who are the active validators and what are the hosts where said validators are accessible over a network?
* What public keys belong to which validator nodes?
* What transactions have been scheduled, started, completed?

```typescript
interface KeyValueStoragePlugin {
  async get<T>(key: string): Promise<T>;
  async set<T>(key: string, value: T): Promise<void>;
  async delete<T>(key: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 4.6.4 Serverside Keychain Plugins

The API surface of keychain plugins is roughly the equivalent of the key/value *Storage* plugins, but under the hood these are of course guaranteed to encrypt the stored data at rest by way of leveraging storage backends purpose built for storing and managing secrets.

Possible storage backends include self hosted software [1] and cloud native services [2][3][4] as well. The goal of the keychain plugins (and the plugin architecture at large) is to make `Cactus` deployable in different environments with different backing services such as an on-premise data center or a cloud provider who sells their own secret management services/APIs.
There should be a dummy implementation as well that stores secrets in-memory and unencrypted (strictly for development purposes of course). The latter will decrease the barrier to entry for new users and would be contributors alike.

Direct support for HSM (Hardware Security Modules) is also something the keychain plugins could enable, but this is lower priority since any serious storage backend with secret management in mind will have built-in support for dealing with HSMs transparently.

By design, the keychain plugin can only be used by authenticated users with an active `Cactus` session. Users secrets are isolated from each other on the keychain via namespacing that is internal to the keychain plugin implementations (e.g. users cannot query other users namespaces whatsoever).

```typescript
interface KeychainPlugin extends KeyValueStoragePlugin {
}
```

# 5. Identities, Authentication, Authorization

`Cactus` aims to provide a unified API surface for managing identities of an identity owner.
Developers using the `Cactus` Service API for their applications can support one or both of the below requirements:
1. Applications with a focus on access control and business process efficiency (usually in the enterprise)
2. Applications with a focus on individual privacy (usually consumer-based applications)

The following sections outline the high-level features of `Cactus` that make the above vision reality.

An end user (through a user interface) can issue API requests to
* register a username+password account (with optional MFA) **within** `Cactus`.
* associate their wallets to their `Cactus` account and execute transactions involving those registered wallet (transaction signatures performed either locally or remotely as explained above).
* execute a trade which executes a set of transactions across integrated Ledgers. `Cactus` may also executes recovery transaction(s) when the trade was failed with some reason. For example, recovery transactions may be executed to reverse executed transaction result using intermediate account which provide escrow trading service.

## 5.1 Definition of Identities in Cactus

Various identities are used at Cactus Service API.

**Cactus user ID**
* ID for user (behind web service application) to execute a Service API call.
* Service provider assign the role(s) and access right(s) of user in integrated service as part of `Business Logic Plugin`.
* The user can add Wallet(s) which is associated with account address and/or key.

**Wallet ID**
* ID for the user identity which is associated with authentication credential at integrated `Ledger`.
* It is recommended to store temporary credential here allowing minimal access to operate `Ledger` instead of giving full access with master secret.
* Service API enables user to add/update/delete authentication credential for the Wallet.

**Ledger ID**
* ID for `Ledger Plugin` which is used at Wallet
* `Ledger ID` is assigned by administrator of integrated service, and provided for user to configure their own Wallet settings.
* The connectivity settings associated with the `Ledger ID` is also configured at `Ledger Plugin` by the administrator.

**Business Logic ID**
* ID for business logic to be invoked by Cactus user.
* Each business logic should be implemented to execute necessary transactions on integrated `Ledgers` without any interaction with user during its execution.
* Business logic may require user to setup access permission with storing credential before executing business logic call.


## 5.2 Transaction Signing Modes, Key Ownership

An application developer using `Cactus` can choose to enable users to sign their transactions locally on their user agent device without disclosing their private keys to `Cactus` or remotely where `Cactus` stores private keys server-side, encrypted at rest, made decryptable through authenticating with their `Cactus` account.
Each mode comes with its own pros and cons that need to be carefully considered at design time.

### 5.2.1 Client-side Transaction Signing

Usually a better fit for consumer-based applications where end users have higher expectation of individual privacy.

**Pros**
* Keys are not compromised when a `Cactus` deployment is compromised
* Operator of `Cactus` deployment is not liable for breach of keys (same as above)
* Reduced server-side complexity (no need to manage keys centrally)

**Cons**
* User experience is sub-optimal compared to sever side transaction signing
* Users can lose access permanently if they lose the key (not acceptable in most enterprise/professional use cases)

### 5.2.2 Server-side Transaction Signing

Usually a better fit for enterprise applications where end users have most likely lowered their expectations of individual privacy due to the hard requirements of compliance, governance, internal or external policy enforcement.

**Pros**
* Frees end users from the burden of managing keys themselves (better user experience)
  * Improved compliance, governance

**Cons**
* Server-side breach can expose encrypted keys stored in the keychain

## 5.3 Open ID Connect Provider, Identity Provider

`Cactus` can authenticate users against *third party Identity Providers* or serve as an *Identity Provider* itself.
Everything follows the well-established industry standards of Open ID Connect to maximize information security and reduce the probability of data breaches.

## 5.4 Server-side Keychain for Web Applications

There is a gap between traditional web/mobile applications and blockchain applications (web 2.0 and 3.0 if you will) authentication protocols in the sense that blockchain networks rely on private keys belonging to a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to authenticate users while traditional web/mobile applications mostly rely on a centralized authority storing hashed passwords and the issuance of ephemeral tokens upon successful authentication (e.g. successful login with a password).
Traditional (Web 2.0) applications (that adhering security best practices) use server-side sessions (web) or secure keychains provided by the operating system (iOS, Android, etc.)
The current industry standard and state of the art authentication protocol in the enterprise application development industry is Open ID Connect (OIDC).

To successfully close the gap between the two worlds, `Cactus` comes equipped with an OIDC identity provider and a server-side key chain that can be leveraged by end user applications to authenticate once against Hyperledger Cactus and manage identities on other blockchains through that single Hyperledger Cactus identity.
This feature is important for web applications which do not have secure offline storage APIs (HTML localStorage is not secure).

Example: A user can register for a Hyperledger Cactus account, import their private keys from their Fabric/Ethereum wallets and then have access to all of those identities by authenticating once only against `Cactus` which will result in a server-side session (HTTP cookie) containing a JSON Web Token (JWT).

> Native mobile applications may not need to use the server-side keychain since they usually come equipped with an OS provided one (Android, iOS does).

In web 2.0 applications the prevalent authentication/authorization solution is Open ID Connect which bases authentication on passwords and tokens which are derived from the passwords.
Web 3.0 applications (decentralized apps or *DApps*) which interact with blockchain networks rely on private keys instead of passwords.

# 6. Terminology

**Application user**: The user who requests an API call to a Hyperledger Cactus application or smart contract. The API call triggers the sending of the transaction to the remote ledger.

**Hyperledger Cactus Web application or Smart contract on a blockchain**: The entity executes business logic and provide integration services that include multiple blockchains.

**Tx verifier**: The entity verifies the signature of the transaction data transmitted over the secure bidirectional channel. Validated transactions are processed by the Hyperledger Cactus Web application or Smart Contract to execute the integrated business logic.

**Tx submitter**: The entity submits the remote transaction to the API server plug-in on one of the ledgers.

**API Server**: A module of Hyperledger Cactus which provides a unified interface to control/monitor Blockchain ledger behind it.

**Validator**: A module of Hyperledger Cactus which verifies validity of transaction to be sent out to the blockchain application.

**Lock asset**: An operation to the asset managed on blockchain ledger, which disable further operation to targeted asset. The target can be whole or partial depends on type of asset.

**Abort**: A state of Hyperledger Cactus which is determined integrated ledger operation is failed, and Hyperledger Cactus will execute recovery operations.

**Integrated ledger operation**: A series of blockchain ledger operations which will be triggered by Hyperledger Cactus. Hyperledger Cactus is responsible to execute 'recovery operations' when 'Abort' is occurred.

**Restore operation(s)**: Single or multiple ledger operations which is executed by Hyperledger Cactus to restore the state of integrated service before start of integrated operation.

**End User**: A person (private citizen or a corporate employee) who interacts with Hyperledger Cactus and other ledger-related systems to achieve a specific goal or complete a task such as to send/receive/exchange money or data.

**Business Organization**: A for-profit or non-profit entity formed by one or more people to achieve financial gain or achieve a specific (non-financial) goal. For brevity, *business organization* may be shortened to *organization* throughout the document.

**Identity Owner**: A person or organization who is in control of one or more identities. For example, owning two separate email accounts by one person means that said person is the identity owner of two separate identities (the email accounts). Owning cryptocurrency wallets (their private keys) also makes one an identity owner.

**Identity Secret**: A private key or a password that - by design - is only ever known by the identity owner (unless stolen).

**Credentials**: Could mean `user a`uthentication credentials/identity proofs in an IT application or any other credentials in the traditional sense of the word such as a proof that a person obtained a masters or PhD.

**Ledger/Network/Chain**: Synonymous words meaning referring largely to the same thing in this paper.

**OIDC**: Open ID Connect authentication protocol

**PKI**: Public Key Infrastructure

**MFA**: Multi Factor Authentication
